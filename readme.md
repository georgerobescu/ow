# ow
================
ow, on work, is a research project and master thesis part of the MFA Designing Democracy, Sandberg Instituut.

git is used thoroughly as one of the methods during the project, both to reflect on the subject of inquiry (see [ow_draft--1](https://github.com/afincato/ow_draft--1)) and as a redundant practice of work and documentation.

Still considering how to keep a log of all the research material I came and will come across, which I won't directly push over the github repo.
For the moment thinking to keep a simple .md file indexing all the file and if possible (for most part it will be, a direct permalink to the source, plus a permalink to the entry—if there's one—to the log, see below).

For a more appropriate rich-content documentation there's this log — [ow](www.andrefincato.com/ow).
