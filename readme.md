ow
================
ow, *on work*, is a research project and master thesis part of the MFA Designing Democracy, Sandberg Instituut.

git is used thoroughly as one of the methods during the project, both to reflect on the subject of inquiry (see [ow_draft--1](https://github.com/afincato/ow_draft--1)) and as a redundant practice of work and documentation.

In order to keep track of all the material I come across, but without having to git it and push it to the server (GB~GB~GB), I wrote a [small script](http://andrefincato.info/ow/blog/ow-draft-1) that, whenever a new file is added to a specific folder, the file’s name and date of addition are grabbed and copied to an `index.txt`. In this way I can `git-push` it without worrying about size problems (or copyrights).

For a more appropriate rich-content documentation there's this log — [ow](http://www.andrefincato.info/ow).
