A [new project](http://networkeffect.io) by [Jonathan Harris](http://therethere.is/) and [Gregor Hochmuth](http://grex.nyc/), which:
> explores the psychological effect of Internet use on humanity.

and builds a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), "typical" of the internet culture:
> Like the Internet itself, the project is effectively endless, containing 10,000 video clips, 10,000 spoken sentences, news, tweets, charts, graphs, lists, and millions of individual data points, all presented in a classically-designed data visualization environment. To see and hear it all would take hours, but the viewing window is limited to around seven minutes (according to the average life expectancy in the viewer’s country), which induces a state of anxiety, triggers a fear of missing out, and totally frustrates any attempt at completeness.

Aside: 

A couple of brief noted before coming back to it:
* what's the role of using once again Amazon M Turk as a way to gather and process a big quantity of data in order to make the whole project possible?
* is really anxiety a feature of the internet culture? If yes, from which side (if there are sides) does it come from? From the "makers" of the internet or from the users themselves?
