From the book ["Plants, Androids and Operators—A Post Media Handbook"](http://www.metamute.org/editorial/books/plants-androids-and-operators-post-media-handbook-0), a couple of essays I want to read.

*Immanence After Networks—Rózsa Zita Farkas*

> A pertinent question, when looking at the manifestation of radical subjectivities, became if and how so-called ‘feminine aesthetics’ in art practices can act as a vessel for radicalisation, and be a viable way of deploying feminism within biopowerful, patriarchal, systems. Part of my research for Post-Media Lab (PML) became the question of whether feminine aesthetics are in fact, feminist. This question acts as a prerequisite for the text, due to the direct gendering of the terminology.
pp. 90–114.

and *Movements of Safety, A Safety Movement, Safety in Movement—Micha Cárdenas*

> This essay is a call to all feminist hackers, anti-racist coders, gender hackers, genderchangers, queer and trans hackers, political hackers, dancers, movement makers, poets, performers, anti-violence activists and networked activists to come together to help stop violence against queer and trans* people, people of colour, disabled people and women.

> This is a call to people to acknowledge that the internet era has not brought more safety but less. This is a call to say we need more people hacking safety, where hacking involves a creative use of the imagination to solve a problem. Why do we have better software to share pictures of lunch than we do to keep each other safe?
pp. 115–125.

There is also "Stack, Heap, Frame—Martin Howse & Jonathan Kemp" which seems rather obscure (easy word) but interesting—pp. 159–168.
