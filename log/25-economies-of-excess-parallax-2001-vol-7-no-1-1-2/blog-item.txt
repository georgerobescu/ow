A reflection and expansion about the *economies of excess*, beginning from the seminal book [“The Accursed Share”](georges-bataille-the-accursed-share-an-essay-on-general-economy-volume-i-consumption) by Georges Bataille.

> Timely in its spotlight on the economies of excess this issue is an acknowledgement that Bataille’s economic theory now resonates far beyond France. An electrifying appraisal of everything from companionship and knowledge to surplus human consumption, corporeal production and transformation, technology, aesthetics, transnational child adoption, feminist international political economy and speed, economies of excess is guided but not conéned by the writings of Bataille, Baudrillard, Nietzsche, Virilio and Marx. Unravelling these and other signiécant cultural theorists of general economy and surplus energy, the issue’s fourteen contributors concentrate on the expanding universe of excess expenditure, an economic realm liberated from all previous constraints and almost all comprehension. Discovering self-sacriécial and near religious cultural ideas and practices embracing individual spending on products and people amidst opulent consumers and impoverished producers, several of the authors collected here advocate proétless expenditure while others interrogate the postmodern premises of the ruinous contemporary political and economic bonds between men and women, East and West.
