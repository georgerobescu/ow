Some passages, out of the whole exceptional talk-performance, that [Johanna Hedva](http://www.johannahedva.com/biocv.html) shared about her experience of having?, of being? a sick body in a neoliberal, wellness-obsessed, western society.

> I am sick (English language) ≠ The sickness has become to me (native American language).

> Abolishing the binary sick/well. 
(sick, from the capitalist point of view, means being unable to work. Disability, without the ability to be sold for its labour)

> "Be well, get well soon", as an imperative of having a choice if you're body is suffering of chronic illness(es).

> The insistence on the power that we have to heal ourselves is a neoliberal, brainwashing, white supremacist idea that stinks of upper and middle class privilege.

> The most anti-capitalist form of protest is to care for another ➝ e.g. nursing, nurturing, caring (all feminised, hence invisible, attributes).
