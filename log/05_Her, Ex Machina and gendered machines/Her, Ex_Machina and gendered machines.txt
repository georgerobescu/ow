Some weeks ago I watched *Ex_Machina* ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGzRB4Pnq8)), and almost a month before *Her* ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzV6mXIOVl4)).

Boths films create a universe in which machines, of some sorts—in the first case a robot with fully developed AI, in the second *just* a computer with fully functional AI—interacts with human beings. 

In both cases the computer is gendered and happen to be a woman. In Her, this is because while setting up the computer for the first time, the main male character opted for a female voice. In Ex_Machina, the decision is taken by the creator of the robots and the test-guy just has to deal with it (there's of course a line in which he, impersonating the nerd guy feeling a bit uneasy when talking about sexuality, asks to the boss why he chose to build femal robots and not male robot [^1]).
