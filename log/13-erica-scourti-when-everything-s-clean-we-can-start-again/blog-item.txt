Text: 

As an exercise after the workshop in which she *cleaned* people's devices (iPhones, tablets, etc.), Erica Scourti set up a two hours timeframe where she tries to recall what happened and note down impressions, quotes and other related fragments.

The whole text is quite nice in its being very mundane, mostly for the kind of environment she performs such task: her bed.

She goes into details in comparing her device-cleaning session to what I call maintenance work: cleaning, taking care of the overall framework that let a specific space, object, etc. to work.

> Okay. Going back. Here’s a quote:

>> “maintenance of digital infrastructures are forms of labour very rarely discussed”
>> “infrastructure is also the invisible and time-consuming labour that underpins our electronic world” Judy Wajcman, Keynote at Transmediale 2015

> I’d been doing this phone cleaning project for a while already when I came across this quote/ sitting and cleaning other people’s phones and then keeping the dirty screen wipes.

> Dirt as a kind of medium, an encrypted trace- it tells you ‘something happened here’ but it doesn’t say what. It preserves privacy. It’s also a very micro/ personal scale of materiality of technology- even what Ingrid Burrington refers to as these ‘black amulets’ collect and carry traces of their use, a literal embodiment of the time spent swiping tapping zooming scrolling. Truly intimate data. Wiping off someone else’s intimate data proved to be pretty awkward. A sense of anxiety thT somehow it gave me access to something hidden, something hidden behind the lock screen.

What does it mean to clean nowadays (cfr. cleaning the screen of a phone, the algorithm which scans, detects and cleans out pornographic images from a website, and so forth) and what its consequences?

Aside: The idea of maintenance work was one of the first ones that captures my interest and around which I build some knowledge, but then I wasn't really able to find a way to translate it into a project. Still, I think it can be part of the underlying foundational ideas on which I am working on, also simply as an attitude towards work.
