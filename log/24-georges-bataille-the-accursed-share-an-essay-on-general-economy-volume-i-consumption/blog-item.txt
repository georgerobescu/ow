Text: > This first essay addresses, from outside the separate disciplines, a problem that still has not been framed as it should be, one that may hold the key to all the problems posed by every discipline concerned with the movement of energy on the earth—from geophysics to political economy, by way of sociology, history and biology. Moreover, neither psychology nor, in general, philosophy can be considered free of this primary ques­ tion of economy. Even what may be said of art, of literature, pf poetry has an essential connection with the movement I study: that of *excess energy*, translated into the effervescence of life.
