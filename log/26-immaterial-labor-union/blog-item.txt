The [Immaterial Labor Union](http://ilu.servus.at) is a:

> decentralized labour union which occupies the space of the "social factory": Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, etc, where we're being stripped off of our data for the profit of a privileged few. With this zine we hope to deconstruct what it means to equate social media with labor. Each issue will hopefully tackle a piece of the digital economy puzzle and bring a better understanding of our condition as workers.
