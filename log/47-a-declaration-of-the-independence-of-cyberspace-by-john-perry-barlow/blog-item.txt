Text: 

Putting aside the repudiation (too strong?) of the body present in the text, claiming that is not part of the new virtual world—which I find quite ridicule and I do prefer the cyberfeminist take on it (the body is part of the internet)—this bit is quintessential.

> Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.
