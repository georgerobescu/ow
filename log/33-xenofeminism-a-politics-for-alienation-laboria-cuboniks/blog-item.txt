Favourite passages from the [Xenofeminist manifesto](http://www.laboriacuboniks.net):

> XF seizes alienation as an impetus to generate new worlds. We are all alienated—but have we ever been otherwise? It is through, and not despite, our alienated condition that we can free ourselves from the muck of immediacy.  (...) The construction of freedom involves not less but more alienation: alienation is the labour of freedom's construction. Nothing should be accepted as fixed, permanent, or 'given'—neither material conditions nor social forms. XF mutates, navigates and probes every horizon.

> We want to cultivate the exercise of positive freedom—freedom-to rather than simply freedom-from—and urge feminists to equip themselves with the skills to redeploy existing technologies and invent novel cognitive and material tools in the service of the common ends.

> (...) suggestions to pull the lever on the emergency brake of embedded velocities, the call to slow down and scale back, is a possibility available only to a few—a violent and particularity of exclusivity—ultimately entailing catastrophe for the many.

> We want neither clean hands nor beautiful  souls, neither virtue nor terror. We want superior forms of corruptions.

>The universal must be grasped as generic, which is to say, intersectional. (...) a political orientation that slices through every particular, refusing the crass pigeon-holing of bodies. (...) This non-absolute, generic universality must guard against the facile tendency of conflation with bloated, unmarked particulars—namely Eurocentric universalism—whereby the male is mistaken for the sexless, the white for the raceless, the cis for the real, and so on.

> To say that nothing is sacred, that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and to hack, is to say that nothing is supernatural.

> Poetry, sex, technology and pain are incandescent with this tension we have traced.

> The potential of early, text-based internet culture for countering repressive gender regimes, generating solidarity among marginalised groups, and creating new spaces for experimentation that ignited cyberfeminism in the nineties has clearly waned in the twenty-first century. The dominance of the visual in today's online interfaces has reinstated familiar modes of identity policing, power relations and gender norms in self-representation.
