A well focused piece drawing a parallel between the ethics of the monks and nuns before Capitalism (which, following the author, they helped in setting up all around Great Britain) and nowadays current life-work-work situation.

> The Romans divided a day equally into 12 ‘hours’ of light and 12 of dark. Consequently, the duration of an hour varied considerably according to the season. For example, in a city like Lindum (present-day Lincoln), a lunch hour could last 84 minutes in summer, but just 37 minutes in mid-winter. This level of uncertainty was a serious problem for medieval monks. They believed that every action served God (a kind of perpetual liturgy) and, as such, the rhythm of the day and its orderly division into periods of prayer, sleep and work, was extremely important. They spent most of their time alone, only coming together at certain times in the day for specific activities, intended to reinforce the monastery as the aforementioned community of individuals. Without accurate timekeeping, it was impossible for each monk in his room to know when it was time to meet—hence, monks pioneered the use of mechanical clocks. These early timepieces had no dials, simply bells that rang out in the cloisters.

> Once time had been standardised in this way, new types of measurement began to emerge; with fixed periods, monks knew if they were getting more or less work done than on the previous day. This gave rise to the concept of productivity, as it was better to make more for God than less. The puritan work ethic, and the entire concept that work is fundamentally good, comes from this discovery. Very soon, the monks began to realise that methodical and structured collaboration resulted in higher-quality products when compared with unregulated, solitary work. They had developed the division of labour.

> After the Reformation, the monks and nuns formed associations dedicated to commerce and trade. From Clarks shoes and Cadbury, to Barclays and Lloyds, many of the oldest British companies were formed by puritan orders that emerged from the ruined monasteries. They used the division of labour and ethic of productivity to create as much abundance for God as possible; in other words, they pursued profit. Within a century this propelled Britain from a European backwater into the most technologically advanced country on earth. It put an end to feudalism, created capitalism, spawned an empire and colonised a continent. 

> If we consider the statistics on how we live today, we seem to be returning to a monastic form of life: little or no sex, no children, one-room apartments in a closed complex, or little cells in a shared house. The architecture of the monastery is today reflected in every dwelling.

> However, more powerful than any of these factors is the return—after several centuries of lying dormant—of the monastic concept of perpetual work. The collapse of work and leisure means our sense of self and identity is defined almost exclusively by what we do, and what others (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc) say about what we do. We may have replaced God with Mammon, but this ‘always-on’, ‘stand-by’, ‘just-in-time’ lifestyle is monastic in every sense: we are our jobs, just like the monks. This phenomenon is a potent sign, reinforcing the reality that Western society is transitioning to a neofeudal capitalist regime of extreme privilege and wealth inequality.
