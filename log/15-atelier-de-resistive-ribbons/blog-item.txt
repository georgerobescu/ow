As part of the [Idiotic Code: On Resistant Usership](http://80.101.51.238/idiotic_code/) symposium and workshops, I also went to the one titled *Atelier de Resistive Ribbons*.

> Atelier de Resistive ribbons—A resistive ribbon is a tactile and multi-handed user-interface developed by J. Taelman, the creature behind Axoloti. In an evening, we combine a box, your old magnetic video tape and copper with some speculative introduction in basic electronics. By creating a potentiometer with conductive contact, we get aware of the socio-political implications of technology and our resistances.

The talk Marthe Van Dessel gave was very nice, and I'd like to go back to her as soon as I start to get my hands dirty.

Aside: I want to keep a reference, somewhere, of her name and of the collective she's part of, [ooooo.be](http://www.ooooo.be).
