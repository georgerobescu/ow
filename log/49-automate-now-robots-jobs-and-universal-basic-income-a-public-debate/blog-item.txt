A couple of notes I jotted down while watching the video:

* ubi → decommodifies labour
* ubi → brings a new set of ethics (work ethics is reduced and or replaced with a different and or new ethics); but what about the situation of the internet user in this? Can he she it escape from it?
* job → a series of tasks; robots will take on tasks, not on jobs
* shadow work [^1]
* at [1:25:55](https://youtu.be/ShmbzDceuYo?t=1h25m55s) a woman brings up a question I am asking myself quite a lot, which is "How do we decide which *creatures* benefit from a universal basic income? What about children, and especially, what about robots?"

[^1]: "In economics, shadow work refers to unpaid labor in the form of self service. The term was first used by Ivan Illich, in his 1981 book of the same title. An example would be self checkout at a supermarket." [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_work)
