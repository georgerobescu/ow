On Sunday, 18 October the book will be presented at [W139](https://www.facebook.com/events/595237223941782/) in Amsterdam—part of a [seminar](http://80.101.51.238/idiotic_code/) which runs in parallel to a [one month exhibition](http://w139.nl/en/article/23402/chu/), I'll come back to it soon. Meanwhile:
> A major new manifesto for a high-tech future free from work
Neoliberalism isn’t working. Austerity is forcing millions into poverty and many more into precarious work, while the left remains trapped in stagnant political practices that offer no respite.

> Inventing the Future is a bold new manifest0 for life after capitalism. Against the confused understanding of our high-tech world by both the right and the left, this book claims that the emancipatory and future-oriented possibilities of our society can be reclaimed. Instead of running from a complex future, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams demand a postcapitalist economy capable of advancing standards, liberating humanity from work and developing technologies that expand our freedoms.
