Materials on the history of the term `affective labor` and its difference with `emotional labour`:

> Does anyone have any insight on the intellectual history behind the term 'affective labor' or want to shed light on its orgins in Marx's "The Fragment on Machines" in Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie (Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy)?

> When I had this question I started with Arlie Hochschild's 1983 book, "The Managed Heart" (which coins the term "emotional labor"), then Silvia Federici's "Caliban and the Witch" and the essays collected in "Revolution at Point Zero." I found this explicitly feminist background helpful as context and counterpoint to how Hardt/Negri develop the idea of "affective labor" in "Empire" and "Multitude."
