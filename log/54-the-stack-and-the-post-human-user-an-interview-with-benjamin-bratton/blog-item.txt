Excerpt on The Stack as a composite machine, the user, the interface and post-humanism.

> **What is the Stack? Does it already exist or is it a speculative notion**?  

> *It is both. It is the name for the accidental megastructure of planetary scale computation and it is a way of seeing that megastructure as a single meta-technology*.  Instead of seeing various kinds of computation, like smart grids, cloud computation, next generation interfaces, addressing systems, robotic artificial intelligence as a bunch of different species of computation, all moving on their own, *we can understand them as forming part of a large composite armature that is in form and content not so unlike the software-hardware stacks* (like OSI or TCP-IP).  There are modular layers in the Stack, each of which has a specific role to play, and each is both independent and interdependent in relation to the other layers. I think there is value in thinking from this totality, and that this would allow for the possibility of designing and re-designing this infrastructure.

> This is not only an issue of engineering, because computation has become the form and the content through which we organise our ideas, economies and cultures. It is not only a way in which governance operates, but it has become governance itself.

> **If it is this vast, enormously complex entity, and if it is governance itself, does this suggest that it is un-overseeable? This seems to imply that we are inside it, rather than looking at it from the outside. How does that allow for a design or engineering approach**?

> (...) Part of the rationale of stack systems in general is that anything that operates on one layer can be replaced by a completely different mechanism as long as it communicates protocollogically with the layer above and below it. Stack systems are in and of themselves designed to be re-designed. (...) This is also the way stack systems work. Over the next decades almost every component of this mechanism may be replaced, and yet the diagram remains.

> Part of the original impetus for the project of my book is to look at the way planetary-scale computation has deformed the political geography of the West-Phalian state system, the coherency of the modern nation state.  So instead of understanding the plane upon which the subdivision of the earth would work as a kind of horizontal layer, subdivided into loops on land, in fact what we see is that the real contestations of sovereign claims is one on top of the another. (...) We need to find a conceptual model through which that verticality and that layering can be understood. Not as the exception to the rule, not a kind of pirate-space, but rather as the new norm.  We need it to be able to deal with it as the new norm, without being forever scandalized by the way in which it works. We need to energize the frictions that these layers on top of one another actually provide. The Stack functions not only as a piece of technology, but also as a piece of geography: as a way of mapping jurisdictions, sovereignties.

> **So the Stack is not a cybernetic idea**?

> Not primarily, but there are ways in which you can read some of the questions that arise from the Stack idea with cybernetic vocabularies that may be useful. There are ways in which technologies that have begun as technologies for observation or measurement or surveillance, have become technologies of design or transformation or governance. Some things that were sensors have become effectors, in cybernetic vocabulary. We see this happening all the time: the transposition of something that was a sensor into an effector or a map into an instrument. This is one of the key logics of the interface layer. One way to read the history of the graphical user interface with terms from the history of the diagram. With diagrams there is this reductive synthesis of information into a set of spatial and conditional relationships. It is a way in which an event or system or process is rendered and synthesized into an image. This chain of signification works one way; the diagram is a kind of sensor. A diagram is a way in which something that is happening in the world is captured in a model. ‘Interface’ inverts the chain of signification: in manipulating the interfacial diagram, you can affect the thing the diagram is representing. It may be possible to identify the circumstances in which this could give rise to a nested homeostasis.

> However, I would caution against reading The Stack as a kind of systems theory.  The best way to understand the Stack is as a kind of platform. Not all platforms are stacks, but all stacks are platforms. Platforms we need to understand not only as a technical model but as an institutional model as well. (...) One is that a platform is a set of mechanisms put in place that allows for the undirected use of these mechanisms to produce emergent effects, which are not intended or planned in advance with the initiation of the mechanisms. A platform is a set of strategic potentialities. The way one is set up in advance will contain the phase space of possibilities in a certain way.  In the same way that Google will organise the logic of the Internet around information rationalisation, it doesn’t make the content of the Internet, it makes the mechanism by which everybody else makes the content of the Internet. And in doing so I think there are two forms of platform value that are produced by this. There is a platform user value, by which the information that I put on the platform is more useful to me because it is on this platform in such a way that it can be circulated. Thereby there is an increase in the opportunity costs of using any other platform and a decrease in costs in continuing to use the one platform. And there is also a platform surplus value and that is that the platform extracts more value of the information that is put there as well. (...) There is a lot of confusion about how we might govern planetary scale computation that is unnecessarily brought about by understanding it through a binary matrix of states versus markets, or public versus private. Like in the example: ‘How is it that that the state should govern these private actors?’ I think by understanding the way states and these markets function both as platforms in a certain way, the real questions (which are not easier) of what the political status of the user is in relation to the platform can at least be configured. States have citizens, markets have consumers, and platforms have users. And what the ethical responsibility to and from users and platforms is, is something we don't have a good language for.

> **Would you say that the market and the state operate as platforms**?

> (...) It would seem that the interface is very much the place where the politics of a platform are shaped. The interface structures structuring the potentiality of the platform, towards the platform itself, and towards the user.

> Let's take the GUI [graphical user interface] as a generic starting point. In order for any interface to be useful, to be operational, it has to be reduced into a set of things that allow participation to be at the scale of the gesture, as opposed to conceptualising the whole. This is inevitably a kind of ideological reduction of what those possibilities are. The extent to which we become ‘culturated’ into a particular space of that reduction is what I call an interfacial regime. There may be multiple interfacial regimes that we come in contact with over the course of the day, each of which is describing the rest of the whole to us in a particular way. They have a narrative logic, they have a value proposition, but they are also tools by which those logics are instantiated. It’s a value system and when you use it, it materially reinforces itself. But the interface is also the way in which the rest of the Stack sees the user.

> **In your Stack model, the user can be human, but doesn’t have to be. What is the user in the Stack**?

> When we say user-centred design, we focus on human users. Now, anything that can initiate what I call a column, that can activate all the layers of the Stack, can be a user. It is worth thinking about the layers as actually working sequentially, when one message is sent from one user to another user. The user sends a message to the interface layer, the address layer, all the way down to the earth layer, and then to the other user back up through all the layers of the Stack. It is important to keep in mind that in the simple movement of one message of a user to a user, the entire apparatus is invoked, the whole at once. But anything that initiates these columns is a user. That could be a person, but it could also be a high-speed trading algorithm, it could be an animal, vegetable, mineral, driverless car, whatever you want it to be. We see most of the traffic on the Internet is already non-human. This co-participation within the space of the Stack, with other machinic, animalian, algorithmic co-inhabitants will be one of the more difficult philosophical challenges for us to deal with. This is not radical cosmopolitanism, or the deeply universal suffrage in the Latourian sense of a Parliament of Things, because it's not a parliament, it's a machine. It is not a philosophical recognition; it's a mechanical co-participation. It's not about transference of sovereign will through mechanisms of representation by which some sort of transparent majority outcome is what steers it as a whole - that is not the mechanism. But to deal with the highly contingent status of the human user towards other users will be a big problem. I actually foresee a whole range of different varieties of humanist fundamentalism over the course of the next decade, pushing back against this.

> **This is one way in which understanding the platform as a third kind of organisational principle next to the market and next to the state becomes very urgent because otherwise we can only see users as either consumers or citizens and they could be very different things as well**. 
Exactly. And the kind of discourses we have about the status of the user, from Wikileaks etc., are trying to counter-weaponise the atomic, anomic individual in relationship to the state apparatus. But I think the potentiality for the user as a subject position is not about the individual withdrawal from this thing and a kind of Second Amendment weaponisation through encryption and privacy, but rather through the multiplication and pluralisation of user positions.
 One of the real problems of interface design is that is supposes that an interface is used by one user at a time. It individuates and interpolates people as individual users, but in fact we are collaborating through these mechanisms in different ways and if we could understand how it is that we would design these interfaces for these distributed collaborative user positions we would have something going there. The example I use is  proxy-users. When you have a proxy user system, the user is in one location, but as far as the interface is concerned it thinks it is coming from somewhere else. The user is not identical to the person. You could also have two users that are actually one person. It almost doesn't matter at one point whether you know which composite user you might be participating in at a particular time, any more than it is necessary for the bacteria in your body to know what your driver’s license number is.

> *The question of how we will even define the parameters and delineate the forms of the different kinds of user positions that any of us move in and out of over the course of the day, is interesting. In other words: when we can conceptually separate the idea of the agency and political rights responsibilities of the user from those of the individual human organism, and no longer understand these as isomorphically mapping on one another, we can have a much better conversation. Not because that would be 'good', but because it would help us to get a handle on where we are right now, at the very least*.

> **The user layer in the Stack is open to many different kinds of agency. Could you elaborate on non-human, and non-machinic kinds of agency in the user layer of the Stack? Is it conceivable that for instance icebergs, clouds, animals or plants develop a kind of user agency beyond just being ‘read’**?

> Yes, I think it is possible to imagine this in a number of different ways. Just as there is no clear difference between a human user and a machinic user, or a physical machinic user and an algorithmical machinic user, in the same way there is not necessarily a clear-cut separation between the vegetable phylum and other types of users. Those kinds of cyborgian composites can operate with plants and bees; rivers and icebergs just as well as they can with us. There are a couple ways in which you can think about this. *One is that the forms of communication that take place in a complex localized environment are already much more dense and rich than those we have the ability to model right now. Everything is talking to everything else constantly*.

> So, it wouldn’t be a matter of introducing information flows as such into the situation. But you could prosthethisize some of these information flows, so that something operating in one position could sense or activate or participate with information in some way that is different than its normal capacity might be. This could change the nested layers of homeostasis that are happening in a situation. So yes, the prosthetization, cyborgisation of plants, flowers and bees is where we could see such a thing. Geo engineering at a biotechnological level. For another way to think of the design space related to this it is worthwhile to go to the address layer. Anything that has the capacity to participate in this system has to be identifiable, has to have a place on the map and a position from which to speak. Now, with the Internet this largely works through the IPv4 addressing system. (...) IPv6 is the new iteration, which has a 128 bit address space, so if you do the math and divide that by 7 billion people, it comes down to roughly 10 to the power 23 addresses per person. That is Avogadro's number in addresses per person.

> So, if you wanted to go through your entire life and distribute an IP address to every single thing you ever have been in contact with, it would never exhaust. You're nearly down to the level of molecules in the things you come in contact with. But if you subdivide that number by a larger number of users, not 7 billion humans, but when you're down to individual daffodils and bees and insects having an allocation of addresses to a certain degree - then you would get a conception of the site condition by which such a scenario (with non-human users) could be designed.

> (...) But when you have this deep addressability, it is possible to imagine things at very different physical scales being able to exchange real information with one another, in ways they haven't been able to before. It's not just that there would be a conceptual relation between these objects; there would also be an actual exchange of information possible.

> Something in the scale of 10 to the minus 9 meter can exchange information with something in the scale of 10 to the 9th meters. What do they say to each other? We don't really know. It's this idea of a chain of information exchange between things at scales that previously were highly mediated at the very least or otherwise totally incommunicable to one another, that allows for this kind of alien communication that is enormously exciting.

> There are ways in which you can understand all of these natural processes as somewhat algorithmic, and in this way you might come to think of the Stack as a secondary planetary computer, on top of the first one (*the Black Stack*?). Maybe this relates to more of an interlacing of this synthetic computation and natural computation that is already at work.

> **The Stack as a way to communicate across scales doesn’t happen in organic ecology. If this happens it will happen through the interface layer. At the moment interfaces are mainly human, partly machinic artefacts, intended for humans and machines. In this scenario, what would be the interfaces by which non-human organic users would access it**?

> If the interface is first of all a map of the space of possibilities, instrumentalised in such a way that when it is manipulated, it can essentially do whatever it is representing. What does that mean for a bee or a tree or a forest or an aardvark? (...)

> This is exactly the right question, the question that follows from the implication of the Stack. What would be the vernacular in interfaces that we might employ on behalf of these non-human users to introduce them into this system, and what would be the conditions by which they would be able to create, propose, optimize another regime of interfaces for one another that humans don't necessarily need to participate in?

> (...)

> There is a parallel in which the non-human user is discussed here and the way it is discussed in Object Oriented Ontology and Speculative Realism, against the backdrop of the Anthropocene and post-humanism.  But I would want to make an important differentiation here: what OOO and SR can contribute to describing this situation is as true now as it was a century ago or 2015 BC - theirs is an ontological position.

> But I'm not making an ontological argument here. I'm making an argument about a technological mechanism and infrastructure that would produce a condition for instrumental relationships in which these things are co-participating in a very specific way which would be impossible 20 years ago, let alone 2000 years ago.

> So let's not conflate the functioning of a particular apparatus with an ontological argument that may be as idiosyncratic or universal as you may find it to be.

> **Questions about the Anthropocene and the apocalypse and what comes after it**

> I make a pretty strong distinction between transhumanism and post-humanism. It has to do with the way in which each employs the figure of the human. In the simplest sense, transhumanism is a project about a reification and amplification of the individual humans as self-encapsulated and self-mastered organisms that can innovate and expand themselves as individuals. The X-Men reading of Atlas Shrugged. Whereas I see post-humanism as the space of potential that becomes clear when the contemporary Copernican traumas of the anthropocenic predicament with the contemporary technologies like nanotech and biotech are understood as challenges to that conception of the human the transhumanists are fetishizing, and become pre-conditions for an alternative epistemology that would locate the specificity of human sentience in a different context. I see them really as projects working in totally opposite directions.

> **In short: transhumanism is excessively anthropocentric, and post humanism isn't**.

> Yes, post humanism would be deeply suspicious of anthropocentric starting points, whereas with transhumanism it is the whole point of it. While it is absolutely true that human thinking and one’s own neuro-cognitive state are ultimately reducible to physics, that doesn't mean it is simple to put it onto a silicon substrate, as the transhumanists love to think. I think we can pre-suppose that the last thing to survive the transposition of the medium of embodiment of a neuro-identity network would be any coherent sense of ego and identity that existed in the biological body. It may be a very good project to try it, but because it would annihilate the previous logic of identity, not because it would amplify it.

> **How does the post-human map on the user in the Stack**?

> The position of the user in the Stack forces a kind of post-human epistemological framework to be deployed, because we have to make sense of our correspondence with these non-human actors that this mechanism we have produced has put us into. We're now cousins and neighbours with them in ways we previously weren't. The user is a technological relationship, one that requires the epistemological framework of the post-human. Non-human users don't necessarily map on the figure of the post-human, but both are cyborgian in nature. These are all interwoven; it is no longer animal versus vegetable versus machinic creatures.
