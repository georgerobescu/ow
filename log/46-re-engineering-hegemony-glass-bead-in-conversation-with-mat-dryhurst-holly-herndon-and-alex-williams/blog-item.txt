> [Alex Williams] The political side of platforms, as I understand it, comes in the way they recede into the background. They are literally fundamental, in the sense of being the ground on which practice occurs, yet successful platforms have a tendency to appear merely neutral. In this sense, they can control and guide action occurring atop them. In terms of IT platforms, the license to print money which Microsoft, for example, obtained in the nineties with Windows, was entirely about its ability to function as a smooth, apparently neutral platform environment. In the business studies literature on platforms, the ability to present yourself as a neutral space is deemed extremely important.

> Beyond a certain tipping point, platforms become difficult not to use. All this means that power, and a conservative form of power at that, is deeply involved in platforms within the human world. But I think it is also important to emphasize that the reason platforms become successful is partly because they enable you to do things; they are productive, generative. Those seeking to oppose a given platform—a technical one, like Microsoft, Google, or Apple, or a political one, like Neoliberalism, or an aesthetic one, like conservative genre boundaries or tuning systems—have to remember that. It implies that a purely negative or transgressive project will be unlikely to be able to seriously disrupt the functioning of existing malignant platforms. Only the building of new, better ones, will suffice. Or perhaps the re-engineering of those already in existence.

> [Mat Dryhurst] I think it’s an interesting analogy for what you guys are trying to do, and somewhat haphazardly what I think we have been trying to do. I did an interview a while back talking about how frustrating I find it that many people in the art world harbor this bias that once something does something, it’s no longer considered art. In many ways I feel that is a really limited perspective, cultivated at a time when people did not have such immediate access to one another. It’s hard to quantify, but there is a large community of curious (in both senses of the word) people in different fields who are all finding each other online, and this synthesis is occurring at greater frequency. It’s the only area I want to operate in.

> Perhaps this synthesis is already happening, and teenagers now are slightly confused at the distinction between fields and people’s dogged identification with one or the other. Music is one way to participate in a synthesis of sorts, but everything we do is pluggable and gestures are not contained to one area or one purpose. The album is a Trojan horse for other elements. The live show is a gathering place and a performance. We just participated in a conference that began as a slack group. It is one thing to aestheticize this synthesis, which a lot of people have attempted to do in the past, and quite the other to embody this synthesis and take advantage of opportunities not previously available.

> [Alex Williams] In the book I’ve just written with Nick Srnicek, Inventing the Future, we discuss the ways in which left politics can be reoriented around a specific future trajectory: the struggle for a post-work society, which uses automation to liberate everyone from the drudgery, misery, and boredom of work. I don’t think, however, that in the domain of culture this means, necessarily, a shift towards nonhuman creativity, per se. Instead, a world where work is minimized, where value is collectively held, and where humans are freed (either entirely or partially) will be a world where creativity is necessarily revalued. This will be as big a shift in the production, dissemination, and consumption of music as the invention of recorded sound, with highly unpredictable effects.
As to the role of music-making in post-capitalist society, this is obviously a matter of total speculation. There has been a strand of socio-musical theorizing (for example, Attali) which would point to the future of music as being one where we all compose, using technology to help mediate the way. In this sense, automation doesn’t necessarily replace human creativity, but rather augments it, and potentially universalizes it.
