I read this book last winter and just now I exported the highlighted passages from the ebook. I'll just report them all here instead of trying to write a comment (or synopsis) on the book.

> **Introduction—by Franco Berardi Bifo**

> There is no return from the precarious condition, because it reveals a truth that for too long we have been hiding from ourselves, and of which we are now finally aware.

> Or is it perhaps the beginning of a precarious humanism, looking for a happy harmony with chaos?

> Solidarity was the political (and admittedly a bit rhetorical) word that used to convey this immediate experience of being together, sharing the same path, the same interests and the same destiny.

* * *

> **Radical Atheism**

> At last, they could swap the ill-fated demand for freedom of religion with the emancipatory cry for freedom from any religion. At last, they could build for themselves communities that did not irradiate from any central totem.

> In fact, what they really needed wasn’t a prayer, but a mantra: an invocation that revolves on itself, a spell that endlessly produces itself, a belief in believing.

> There was only one possible, almost perfect candidate. The activity of repetition par excellence: Work.

> Every so many years, a crisis or a war is needed in order to destroy the supply in excess. We produce too much, we Work too much, and by doing so we regularly destroy our economy.

> Instead of profiting from the ease allowed by a production devolved to machines, humans find themselves competing against technology and are thus forced to reduce their demands and expectations to the level of the machine. We try to work as much and as tirelessly as machines do, and by doing so we turn ourselves into second-rate production machines, never as efficient as the real ones.

> Work is now more obsessive then ever. For the vast majority of the world population waged-labour still remains the only possible way of accessing the resources necessary for survival.

> Work does not simply act as the only entrance to the market of resources, but also as the main platform for the exchange of social recognition,

> Every moment of the day that escapes the universe of Work is a wasted moment, a time of despair and loneliness.

> With the introduction of the non-termination clause, for the first time abstract immortality appeared. Something consciously created by humans suddenly rose above their heads and began a life of its own: a life that could potentially transcend and survive that of its creators.

> It is only by surrendering our will to the abstraction that we, worthless, mortal flesh, might one day be allowed to become as immortal as the abstractions that we erected over our heads.
`Submission (on 19 January 2015 at 22:46)`

> Becoming the chain takes the place of the desire to break away from it.
`cfr. Deleuze & Guattari? (on 19 January 2015 at 22:47)`

> Seen from the other perspective, we may say that a normative abstraction opens a line of debt on its believers’ lives, from which it extracts all the necessary sacrifice and obedience that it needs in order to consolidate its kingdom.

> The system of the promise, as deployed by normative abstractions, does not come without this necessary complement. Although its means of payment is not monetary, the currency which it employs is not that dissimilar in its functioning to contemporary money: hope.

> What would remain to the revolutionary worker, if the Revolution was to happen? Maybe a place in some politburo, below a picture of the great leader, but nothing compares to the immense, overflowing, ultimately useless stock of hope accumulated in a lifetime of obedience.

> Within the landscape of contemporary life, such submission takes place in the form of Work, and in particular of a kind of Work that no longer retains any believable relation to economic production.

> Humans wanted to gain access to that space of immortality, and submitting completely to those who lived in it – the Gods – seemed to be the best way of achieving their goal.

> Radical atheism should simply be a tool for those who desire to exit the systems of Promise and Religion, and to escape from the seductive grip of their chains.

* * *

> **The Last Night**

> Anger towards myself, for my unforgivable obedience. Why had I wasted so much of my life trying to believe in the ‘higher purpose’ of what I was doing?

* * *

> **Squandering**

> If religious discourses originate from the immortal sphere of normative abstractions, the antidote that we are seeking must exist outside of this sphere.

> Despite appearances, potlatch still remains a highly religious gesture.

> Squanderers dissipate their own wealth, but they do so only in their own interest and for their own enjoyment.

> example I’m thinking of is the tragic parable of Sicilian aristocracy.

> So committed were they to their squandering, that they managed to self-destruct as a class decades before the official abolition of the Italian aristocratic orders in 1945.

> they made it impossible for themselves to ever rely on the safety net of the system of the promise of their social class. They didn’t only lose their wealth, but their status and their honour.

> Their sexuality knew no purpose or boundaries: it was pornographic sterility

> This act of looking backwards is the very gesture through which one loads one’s actions and possessions with the hopes and hidden meanings typical of the religious promise.

> ‘respect’. Its origin is the Latin word respicere, which literally means ‘to look back at’ something.

> to be respectful towards a system of belief thus presupposes a mirror-effect attached to every object: as one looks at a possible action or resource, one’s gaze is mirrored back, ‘looking back towards’ the founding religious promise which one has bought into.

> By adopting the method of squandering, Sicilian aristocrats chose not to ‘look back at’ the promises of their order. In fact, they looked away.

> freedom of the flesh, not from the flesh.

> A long process of religious self-delusion has been necessary to pass from the myth of the birth of Work as God’s punishment for the original sin, to the infamous slogan crowning the entrance to Nazi concentration camps, ‘Work will set you free’.

> the French word for Work –travail, from the Latin tripalium, an instrument of torture to which prisoners were bound and burnt alive – and the contemporary discourse about ‘happiness at Work’, as developed by many global enterprises.

> Contemporary squanderers are parasites, who use work as a tool to provide themselves with all they need – or with all they can take.

> They do not believe in the sanity or sanctity of Work, they do not believe in the redeeming features of a perfect career, they recoil from the smothering hold of the office family.

> They don’t fight against their oppressors as hungry, enraged mortals, but as the part of the Proletariat; they don’t struggle against their abusers as vulnerable flesh, but as Women; they don’t reclaim their space of freedom and choice as desiring bodies, but as Homosexuals; and so on.

> The only flag squanderers wave is the shadow they cast as they walk along their path.

> Borrowing from the Greek, we might say that our world is our home, as in oikonomia, the art of imposing an order (nomos) to our home (oikos).

* * *

> **The Wheels of History**

> Representative democracy is not suspended, it is a historical relic. It is over. That dream is over. Today, the space of politics in the West is that of a play in which even real blood looks fake, in which the death of the actors only gains applauses and tears, but never even manages to derail the sliding of the stage curtain.

> This is not the time for assaults, but for withdrawal. This is not time for war, but for revenge – silent, cruel, ghostly.

* * *

> **A Parasite’s Civilisation**

> Immortal, normative abstractions set the unreachable goals and unmeetable standards, which Civilisation ensures are duly and painfully chased by those living under its heel.

> What defines a Civilisation, as opposed to a general congregation of people, organisms or ideas? Why did we connect it to the origin and, indeed, to the essence of religious thought and practice?

> By stitching and cutting words, authors build specific structures of sense – Civilisations, we might say – which define and are defined by their territory, their internal dynamics, their population, and so on.

> In this sense, we can interpret Civilisation as the process of tailoring an as-yet-inexistent shape out of the supposedly shapeless galaxy of humans, landscapes, interactions, interpretations, and so on.

> The word Civilisation thus describes the work of an invisible artisan, tirelessly re-orienting human and natural life towards a superior, abstract horizon, and, in doing so, ultimately submitting it to the immortal dominion of normative abstractions.

> Normative abstraction is the name that we can use to define an idea or a set of ideas which individuals or collectives place above themselves as the ultimate frame and scope of reference

> This empty signifier – often symbolised by a flag or a slogan – exists as a normative abstraction, and acts as the political equivalent of a Civilisation over the demands that it contains, binding them together and ultimately re-defining them in terms that exceed the original.

> I am the hologram of the totem around which my desires, drives and dreams congregate, I am the literary artifice which allows them to put aside their differences and achieve some sort of functioning union. I, as such, do not exist: I am the populist fiction of my inner world, I function as its Civilisation.

> Radical atheism and the practice of squandering do not aim at a total purity of their ‘adepts’, nor do they incite a celestial pauperism.

> Especially for those squanderers who cannot access a wealth of material resources, State-provided services are essential, despite their murky ideological implications.

> “I am not resigned, mule. I am joyous, I am complete. I do what I must, and by doing so, what must happen finally includes me too. I was given a life worth nothing and look at me now, I can aspire to be part of something so much bigger than myself, something that includes everything you see around you. Everything must be, and I want it to be so. I must, and I want.”

* * *

> **The Word**

> How could I think of encouraging people to abandon the poisonous environment of religious submission, if all I had to offer as an alternative was the desert of a vague freedom, of a ‘fullness of life’, which I couldn’t even explain?
`Desert, cfr. Carmelo Bene (on 18 February 2015 at 00:32)`

* * *

> **Adventure**

> Adventurers only exist within the time of their own mortality. No heaven or hell, no memory or glory lie beyond the moment in which their bodies start rotting.
`Complete immanence (on 18 February 2015 at 00:50)`

> If the time of Work expands as seemingly limitless as a desert, that of adventure exists as a limited, often frustratingly small, patch of an oasis. Before and beyond us is only the bleak wake of galaxies and dark matter.

> While the time of Religion and Work proceeds along a horizontal, historical series of achievements – in accordance with the set of expectations of one normative abstraction or the other – the time of adventure flows along the sinuous track of the event.

> It is this propellant energy that pushes the time of adventure deeper and deeper under the crust of traditional, linear, clock-time.

> As one approaches what exists outside of oneself, one nears the territory of danger.

> In particular, it is on this grounds that adventurers restrain from taking part in any collective gatherings around any totem dedicated to dominant abstractions such as ethnic, national, gender or class Identities:

> Yet, it is crucial to stress how unions of egoists are federations whose members are at the same time deeply unique in themselves and equal to each other.

> adventurers’ active creation of the world they inhabit is inextricably connected to their feelings of empathy.

> The happiness of death is that of a happy solution, more than that of a happy moment.

> felicitous, successful solution of an issue.

> Because of the very egoism that infuses it, life within adventure is a state of perennial readiness to meet its happy ending.

> A happy death is what drops ripe fruit off a branch – never too late, never too soon. It is a seal, not a guillotine.

> As opposed to the regime of dominant abstractions, in which people’s frantic activity is mainly that of anxiously delaying meeting their end, adventure offers its protagonists a liberation from the fear of this final encounter.

* * *

> **Vanishing**

> allegiance

> Adventurers are antisocial by definition, in that they refuse to recognise Society as a legitimate abstract entity to which they could swear allegiance

> Social recognition only applies to social fictions, while one’s existential choices need the darkness of social oblivion in order to grow fully.

> Adventurers’ desire for social obscurity informs their practices, as well as their personal aesthetics.

> To a social environment that demands the full visual expression of oneself as a tribute that one has to pay to the ghost of Freedom, they respond with a form of visual asceticism.

> And what better vanishing is there, within a landscape of dissimulated conformism, than the full embracement of the most banal visual conformity?
`cfr. normcore! (on 2 May 2015 at 14:48)`

> For all the rest, for the great conquests and the total wars, other means might be more appropriate. Outside of the ‘union of egoists’, there is politics.

* * *

> **The Politics of Adventure in Real Life**

> for example, ‘the moment there are two people in a room, there is politics’. I believe such an abnormal swelling of the field of politics is not only arbitrary, but is also detrimental to politics itself, as well as to the life of individuals.

> The moment the field of politics is stretched to include and regulate the relationships between people, the result is the economisation of the human: individuals are reduced to the status of mere resources.
`The personal is the political, the political is the personal. `
`Everything is political. (on 2 May 2015 at 14:54)`

> Politics has no room for conflict, power or domination, because politics is not a field of conflicting interests.

> Conflict has to do with a completely different set of reasons, which can only be defined as pre-political.

> If the entrance to politics is defended militarily by a rogue State, it is necessary to acknowledge that our path towards politics has to pass through the battlefield of war. Demonstrations with raised hands, petitions, even the representational pantomime of the black bloc are of no use.

> It would be a good start, if we began by restraining ourselves from the cowardly habit of disguising our failing warfare as hyper-complex politics. What is at stake is not the moral ground of our intellectual narcissism, but the possibility of forcing Society, maybe for the first time, to perform its moral duty.

> Adventurers will always be disloyal, hypocritical allies.

* * *

> **Afterword—by Saul Newman**

> In his devastating critique of Feuerbach, Stirner unmasked the hidden religiosity lurking behind the edifice of secular humanism and its political form, liberalism.

> Stirner always warned us about the danger of Causes and their tendency to immolate to them all that is real, unique and sensuously alive in the individual.

> We are religious through and through. Our churchly vestments are our work clothes we put on every morning; our rites and liturgies, obsessively and piously performed, are our daily travails of work and consumption. Our faith is our belief on a return on our investment

> Perhaps the sadness of our times lies in the fact that there is no longer any figure of power which can serve as an excuse for our voluntary servitude, that the mechanism of our submission is entirely visible to us

> To see the world through egoistic eyes is to refuse the renunciation of the self and its enjoyment.

> to associate egoism with the neoliberal model is, as we have said, to ignore the piety, veneration and loss of self that underpins it. Egoism means, on the contrary, that we can love one another in new ways; egoism is the basis for new and more intense forms of comradeship and togetherness that do not, at the same time, involve the sacrifice of the individual to the collective.

> Squandering is neither the realisation of some underlying essence, nor the securing of an identity; it is the deterritorialising of all fixed identities and the creation of something new.

Aside: 

[Federico Campagna](http://www.federicocampagna.eu/About) is a young Italian philosopher and writer, currently based in London. I got to know him because he collaborated and is friend of Franco "Bifo" Berardi. He's into anarchism and autonomist movements.

I'm going through all the quoted passages and comment them in order to rearticulate  some thoughts about the text.
