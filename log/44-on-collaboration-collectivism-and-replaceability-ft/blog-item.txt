> What terrifies me is the co-optation of collectivism-as-ideal by capitalism-as-practice. It's everywhere.

> Separate active forces from what they can do: convince you that your infinite capacities are limited and weak.

> II. Let the meek inherit the earth: Create an ideology of labor where minuscule effort becomes a heroic act.

> III. Internalized resentiment: given our minuscule contributions, there's a limit to how much any single one of us can matter.
> 
> IV. Herd-culling as disciplinary regime: since we're all minor cogs and fully replaceable, we must be grateful for mere continued existence.

> what about d+g?

> There are a number of ways to address this question, all worth noting.
> First, you're familiar with the expression "the exception which proves the rule"?  D&G are literally the only counter-example you'll find.
> More importantly, a dyad is not a committee; a dialogue can be productive in ways that a collective discussion can never hope to be.
> Finally and most importantly, every piece of available evidence suggests the uniqueness and complexity of D&G's collaborative efforts (said evidence includes Deleuze's "Letter to Uno" and the documents by Guattari published under the title The Anti-Oedipus Papers).  The problem I have with collective thinking is the "too many cooks" problem:  it's ineffective to have multiple people performing the same task at the same time.  But it's clear that D&G were performing very different tasks in their joint effort.  Not only different tasks, but in some ways entirely opposite tasks.  Guattari, by far the more neurotic of the two, constantly produced a stream of discourse that ranged relentlessly in a continuous flow.  Deleuze, the philosopher of difference, constantly worked to break down flows into discrete concepts.  Looking at this evidence, we find that Deleuze & Guattari worked *against* each other as much as they worked *with* each other:  Deleuze interrupted Guattari's idea-flow and forced his discourse to break apart; Guattari interrupted Deleuze's conceptual disjunction and forced his concepts to blend together, to bleed into each other.  They were each performing a distinct kind of labor, and a particular effect was generated at the intersection of these two operations.  What made Deleuze & Guattari's collaboration successful was precisely the ways in which they *didn't* think the same and *didn't* do the same kind of work.  This is exactly the opposite of collective thinking which attempts to produce an idea with which the entire group is comfortable.  On the other hand, to whittle away at the edges of a philosophical concept until it doesn't disturb or offend anyone is to render it sterile and useless.  Deleuze & Guattari didn't work together so much as they each did his thing while the other provided a limit and a test-case and a rupture; each did his own thing, and this thing was subtly transformed by the other's influence.  You can see this influence in Deleuze's use of punctuation.  Even though Deleuze was in all cases the one who did the actual physical writing, by comparing his sentence structure to his solo works you immediately see that Guattari's effect was not to make Deleuze share his space, to make Deleuze take up less room so as to leave room for Guattari's thinking.  Rather, Guattari's effect on Deleuze was to spur him on beyond his own limit.  What bothers me about collective or collaborative thinking is the assumption of equality or equity, the idea that each person's contributions are equally valid and important and that each person should get their "turn."  Fuck that.  I'm a conceptual machine.  I'm constantly producing ideas and concepts.  You want to produce alongside me, spur each other on and maybe get a drink after?  Awesome.  But if you expect me to slow down and stop, to constrain my own production while you formulate an opinion, or to withdraw into myself and take up less room at the table so that you can pretend we're "equal," go fuck yourself.  "Step up or shut up" is the only valid model for intellectual cooperation.
