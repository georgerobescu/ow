[Yochai Benkler](http://www.benkler.org) seems a good starting point to dig into the concept of *peer production*, so for sure I'll read the first part of the book, titled *The Networked Information Economy*, containing three chapters:
1. Some Basic Economics of Information Production and
Innovation
2. Peer Production and Sharing
3. The Economics of Social Production

This is a quick note. Quick. I'll come back.
