Hannah Black dissect what's the everyday social life on the internet:

> These platforms (ndr, the post-Internet Internet – the Internet set loose from its putative freedoms and now arranged in life-like fashion around the mega-functions of work and self-maintenance as structured by Facebook, Google, Tumblr, Twitter, etc) are of course also value-producing and attempt the direct conversion of sociality into profit. Like the capitalist dream of robot workers, the direct conversion of life into value is a fantasy about the full negation of labor.

> Now the Internet has come to look more like the non-Internet world: structured by the demands of profit, violent, strange, funny, awful, beautiful, full of desire and the alienation of desire … everything that the world is. There is no technology, and there never will be a technology, that does anything more than mirror, reproduce and at most concentrate and intensify the social relations in which it was produced.

> Many still persist in valorizing anonymity and privacy online, as if, with these conditions intact, the Internet will remain or become a safe space for acts of politics or survival. This idea relies on an under-interrogated conception of the political as arising from autonomy and agency. Perhaps consideration of the histories of anti-colonial struggle and slave uprisings, to give two cases where acts of transformative resistance happened without any meaningful top-down recognition of autonomy, privacy, or even personhood, might complicate this understanding of enclosure. People’s willingness to share intimate details of their lives in collective online spaces means that the dominant critiques of social media, often centered around issues of privacy, simply end up scolding the messy, over-disclosing users for being bad political subjects. Instead it might be more interesting to register the ways in which the existing politics expressed on these platforms already go beyond and complicate ideas about privacy, the commons, and so on.

> When you aggregate the social for example on an app you also aggregate violence. Violence is not hard to mechanize. We already have robots who can do that. Violence is not outside the social. For now, violence is threaded all through. The police are a technology for the generalization of violence. So is the legal system. So are men. Everything is a technology for something. The robot is disappointing. It does not know how to behave. The artist does not know how to behave either, and she is not entirely sure what she is a technology for.
