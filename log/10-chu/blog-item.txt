As part of a general theory of deviance, resistance, obfuscation (see [Ad Nauseam](http://andrefincato.com/ow/ad-nauseam) and [this paper](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3493/2955)) etc. from the user towards and against, for example, data collection, this exhibition at [w139](http://w139.nl) seems very apt:
> The steam bath (– i.e. fog, mist, haze, interference –) is one component of C'hu: an extension of a shared interest in algorithmic, mechanical and biological processes and the ongoing breakdown of the binary logic of the human and non-human at the heart of the cybernetic body. Did we talk already about the-dog-that-was-wolf?

> The show locates the uncertainty inherent to complex systems in the non-linear structure beyond individual perception and proposes the idea of state of distributed autonomy between server networks, architecture, the psychoactive potential of plants, choreography and fog; to help us "un-think what we don't know we are thinking".
Self-intoxication as self-surrection, politics of heat maps, a proposal for mess and a "consent to not be a single being".

I particularly like the combination of the breaking down between human and non-human together with server networks, the potential of plants, choreography and fog.

Though for other reasons, putting close to each other plants (actually fungi) and server networks (or better, hard disks) already popped up during the one-week [Psychic Strike Biennial in Alytus](http://www.alytusbiennial.com/) (Lithuania) I went to this summer, and I find it quite exciting as a research perspective.

Aside: 

FYI:
> From 10 October until 7 November we are operating a public steam bath at the Warmoesstraat 139.

> The steam bath is open on weekdays from 8 AM to 11 AM and 6 PM to 9 PM. In the weekend the steam bath opens from 8 AM–11 AM and 3 PM–9 PM. Towels are provided, but you might want to bring your own bathrobe, slippers, and any additional toiletries you need for a steam session. When leaving the steam bath we invite you to decide for yourself how much you would like to pay.
