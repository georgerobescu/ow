## Chapter #0, Introduction

What does it mean to work, when work is no longer a necessary {{human activity}}{{ what is a human life? }} to make a living?

{{At the same time of a resurgence, in the last period, of an interest in post-work societies, driven by Universal Basic Income and full automatisation of labour, there is{{~~, in parallel,~~}} a more systematic proliferation of tracking processes happening on the internet, out of which web platforms and companies {{extract surplus value from users’ activities}}{{ define }} for their own benefits.}}{{ rewrite less }}

While the two phenomena might not have any relation with each other, {{~~a question~~}} I’d like to pose {{~~is~~}}{{++ the question ++}}: if thanks to a Universal Basic Income, ideally I won’t have to worry about covering the basic needs to set up not a decent, but a good-enough life {{ [^1] }}{{ put your footnote ??? for the note -- i think what i mean is to get rid of the footnote }}, how would this {{affect the situation}}{{ surplus extraction? }} on the internet? {{Would a post-work society be mirrored also in this space?}}{{ ??? }}

[^1]: Since a Universal Basic Income «must be a *supplement* to the welfare state rather than a replacement of it»—Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, Inventing the Future, 2015, pp. 119.

{{% The transition %}} I am interested in exploring{{~~, is~~}}{{ %% }} {{++ of ++}} the passage from the post-fordist worker to the {{internet user}}{{ must define }}, which began in last decade: while the former label has been used to describe a set of employment positions (ranging from care workers to designers, journalists, to call centre employees) that constitute, for the most part, the group of {{precarious, part-time, project-based jobs}}{{ short term contract }}{{;}}{{++ . ++}} with the latter subject, the internet user, I identify the new iteration of worker part of the capitalist society we live in. Both subjects have in common the increase of mental and or {{affective labour}}{{ define, discourse (Negri, Hardt, ??? lang)}} as determining factors in the type of work performed: whereas in the case of the post-fordist worker, the required amount of this labour is specific to the kind of job performed (e.g. maximum level for a care worker, less demanding for an academic {{ service, industry, sales }}), the internet user is a {{subject ontologically defined, in its very formation, by a mix of affective and mental tasks}}{{why?}}. Unlike the post-fordist worker, an internet user of the commercial internet is almost always asked to pour him-herself in the platforms he she makes use of:
> Social media trap us in a tautological loop, in which we express ourselves to be ourselves to express ourselves, trying to claim better attention shares from the people we are ostensibly “connecting” with. (...) It doesn’t matter what we say, or if we came up with it, when all that matters is the level of response. In this system, we don’t express our true self in search of attention and confirmation; instead {{attention posits the true self as a node in a dynamic network, and the more connections that run through it, the more complete and “expressed” that self is.}}{{ must expand to this quote, make it work for *your* point, let it explain + expand what *you are saying*. right now it feels dropped in. what's main take away? }}
Rob Horning, [Preemptive Personalization](http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/marginal-utility/preemptive-personalization/), The New Inquiry, 2014.

Which forms do{{++ es ++}} labour take on the internet, from a user perspective? Though not the only one, the most pervasive is the technique adopted by platforms that most of us, users of the commercial internet, check everyday (facebook, gmail, instagram, whatsapp, twitter and so forth), through which {{they}}{{ define (maybe refer to statement about PSD from workshop transmediale, puts "what's at stake" very well. currently also unclear your position in this shift) }} collect informations we share with other users, in order to sell them to advertisers and present them back to us in the form of tailored ads. {{[^2]}}{{ retargeting — make footnote as example to present your stance — how do you + others respond to this and why? }}

[^2]: A project dealing with algorithmic ads suggestions based on the content users produce is [American Psycho](http://jason-huff.com/projects/american-psycho/), by Mimi Cabell and Jason Huff: «This book was made by sending the entire text of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho between two gmail accounts page by page. We saved the relational ads for each page and added them back into the text as footnotes».

In dealing with the multiform action of tracking, {{~~what~~}} I {{~~want to~~}} explore is {{ attention, affect, labor, life identity, affirming = why user is onto-shift? how diff then adverts? (in which we identify) }} a platform called GitHub and the tool upon which it is built, `git`: tracking, in this case, doesn’t happen as a {{non-aware}}{{ word-choice }} and {{malicious}}{{ why malicious? }} background process, but rather as a deliberate and voluntary activity part of the application software workflow. {{ for ?? at purpose, what is your intention w/ this analysis? what do you want it to do? }}

GitHub {{~~([github.com](https://github.com/))~~}} is a {{website and a platform}}{{ define difference }} where users can share, contribute and download code-based projects: a {{‘social network’}}{{ makes it is a workflow possible (1), turn this into social activity (2) }} for people who use `git` in their {{workflow}}{{ link workflow to fodaung sentence }}. `git` is a version control system for text-based files, which is, a software that, once installed, tracks every change a user makes on one or a set of files, within one or more folders {{she he}}{{ resolve + throughout }} decided {{to look after}}{{ phrasing }}. This is useful to keep track of the work done so far, especially when it is fragmented in a team, while also going back and forth within the project history, if something went wrong or a user needs a specific file now deleted.

Where{{~~as~~}} other internet-based platforms{{~~,~~}} like Uber and Amazon M Turk{{~~,~~}} are {{~~explicit in their intents to be a job-offer for~~}}{{ offer jobs }} someone looking for work, github.com {{~~keeps itself~~}} in the grey area of being for both {{personal and professional use.}}{{ ok, expand more, because how is job alone not personal and professional? define. say what is the meaningfulness of this difference }}

As much as a programmer working at a company can use it for {{his her}} job, a {{weekend website maker}}{{ part-time? hobbyist? }} can use it as well for the same purposes. {{~~Being~~}}{{++ As ++}} `git` {{++ is ++}} only an added element to one’s workflow, the reason{{++ s ++}} for creating an account on github.com are highly subjective{{~~s, and~~}} totally {{in line}}{{ again now distinction from uber-amazon m turk }} with the spirit of the creative post-fordist worker (where famously {{‘work is play and play is work’}}{{ quick reference }}). As a user, the personal takes over the sphere of the professional, transforming both into one smooth space.

{{~~In the act of~~}} {{imagining}}{{ define how you do this }} an expansion in the usage of `git` and GitHub as a model to organise labour on the internet{{~~,~~}}{{++ . ++}} {{~~I wonder  how~~}}{{++ what are ++}} the possible effects {{~~of the above cited~~}} post-work, Universal Basic Income-based society would effect {{++ on ++}} {{this sphere of existence}}{{ explain, eg: I look to this, to this quesiton, to contribute to this }}. {{ rework, make it bigger }} 

By post-work society, I refer to a cultural, social and economical shift in the understanding of labor, where human beings are freed of the need to provide themselves with basic material needs, hence from {{the action of sustaining themselves}}{{ or this is believed in its institutionalisation, or systematisation into what? ... }}. A Universal Basic Income, implemented at a global level and regardless of citizenship status (Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, Inventing the Future, 2015, pp. 119), would provide the means to start this transformation, being it part of the four pillars outlined by Srnicek and Williams to move beyond capitalism {{[^3]}}{{ bring in footnote }}. Post, then, refers to the act of moving away from the action of work as the defining activity of one’s life {{~~(~~}}both in the form of making one’s life materially possible, as well as fulfilling one’s needs of meaning and direction in such life{{~~)~~}}{{ don't hide it in ( ), this is key point }}. {{~~While~~}} in books such as ‘Inventing the Future’ (Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, 2015){{~~,~~}} there seems to be a total automatisation of labour, and in particular of what they refer to as ‘shit job’ [^4]{{~~,~~}}{{++ . But ++}}what they actually mean is a diminution of tasks human beings have to perform within a job{{~~,~~}} rather than the full replacement of it by machines [^5]. In short, they reinforce the thesis of a {{more tight}}{{ word choice }} collaboration between human beings and machines{{~~, while in~~}}{{++ as part of the ++}}{{ give example, counterfeit shadow workforce }} the process of moving toward a post-capitalist society [^6].

[^3]: The other three being: fully automating the economy (full-automatisation of labour), reducing the working week, achieving a cultural shift in the understanding of work (Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, Inventing the Future, 2015, pp. 108).

[^4]: From [urbandictionary.com](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Shit%20job): «An unfulfilling, tedious waste of 8+ hours of the day, five days of the week, that you only persist with in order to pay the bills and the ever mounting debt that comes from having to increase your spending in order to entertain yourself outside of working hours as you are so brain dead from the hours you spend in work.»

[^5]: See this panel titled ‘Automate Now? Robots, Jobs and Universal Basic Income A Public Debate’, 2015: at time 1:25:30 they clarify what they mean by full automation — [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShmbzDceuYo&feature=youtu.be&t=1h25m30s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShmbzDceuYo&feature=youtu.be&t=1h25m30s).

[^6]: Still, the advancement of machine automatisation also brought what is referred to as ‘shadow work’: self-check out devices at the supermarket, self-service petrol stations, self check-ins at the airport—all tasks that on one side give the impression of a more agile service, but, on the other, have the effect of cutting on personnel and assign a considerate amount of labour to the customer.

{{{{++ In ++}}{{~~The~~}} reframing {{~~of~~}} the importance toward the activity of work as a life-meaning vector}}{{phrasing}}, also includes the questioning of the driving force through which {{«each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being»}}{{ ? }} (Frédéric Lordon quoting Benedictus de Spinoza in Ethics, part III, Willing Slaves of Capital, 2014, pp. 14). This is the concept of conatus expressed by Benedictus de Spinoza in his book {{++ " ++}}Ethics{++ " ++}}, in this text {{++ conatus ++}} understood as both a force present in each thing constituting the world, which permits them to survive and let them being what they are{{~~;~~}}{{ . }} but also, since their strive to persevere in their being, conatus as a drive to foster a process of self-iteration and of {{always-becoming}}{{ needs definition }} over time. {{~~Framed in this way~~}}, how can the spinozian conatus be applied to the internet user? {{ need stronger explanation link to internet labour }}

The separation between {{performing work to sustain one’s life}}{{ show gap between vs }}, and {{working for a {{~~different~~}}{{++ other ++}} set of reasons and values}}{{ questions what translate?, in doing so repositions puts under microscope what life is, what make necessity }}, becomes central in analysing the iteration from post-fordist worker to internet user. This separation of intentions, indeed, is already present on the internet nowadays: most of users’ interactions and value-production {{are made for free, be it because part of invisible value-extraction mechanisms}}{{ link bamck to Horning point as counter }} (e.g. {{social networks}}{{ eg targeting }}); or as a genuine interest in contributing to a {{common good}}{{ explain why common good }} (for example wikipedia). With the advent of an hypothetic post-work society, this shift might get stronger.

The other element {{~~defining the environment of the project~~}} I am working on{{~~,~~}} {{is the concept of the posthuman turn}}{{ this is integral to theses? define discourse }}. As a set of theories describing the decentering of the human being as measure of all things in the world, the definition of user given by Benjamin Bratton (Benjamin H. Bratton, The Stack—On Software and Sovereignty, 2016, pp. 287) is of significant importance: a user is anything able to produce data and exchange it, through the help of interfaces, with other {{users}}{{ define, define, define earlier }}. This definition appears fundamental when talking about labour on the internet between users: the human user is only one of the possible entities this position can be inhabited by, opening it up to users with animal, plant, machinic, mineral, algorithmic (and so forth) natures (ibid, pp. 272–273).

Data assumes the role of raw material through which performing communicative acts between users of different natures: {{finding}}{{ word choice }} an interface to get in contact with other users becomes essential. {{ is it "found" or data developed-determined by the chosen interface / interface design? eg "language of interface" for interoperability }} Tracking, defined as a process of keeping tab of what happened and what is happening, can be used to build new kinds of {{~~these~~}} interfaces. Furthermore, the action of tracking on `git` and github.com, traverses both the sphere of ethics and labour: what are the implications between users, when performing {{this}}{{ what action }} action, and how does {{this}}{{ what-tracking? }} affect one’s work? Overall, {{how does tracking organise such activities?}}{{ why is this important? is this really your main?? if not, cut and replace as it is end of intro = crucial moment }}
