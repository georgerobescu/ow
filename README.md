# ow
================
ow, on work, is a research project and master thesis part of the MFA Designing Democracy, Sandberg Instituut.

git is used thoroughly as one of the methods during the project, both to reflect on the subject on inquiry (see [ow_draft--1](https://github.com/afincato/ow_draft--1)) and as a redundant practice of work and documentation.

Still considering if pushing over here all the research material I found (pdfs, mp3, etc.) in one way or another. For a more appropriate rich-content documentation there's this log â€” [/ow](andrefincato.com/ow).
