# Cioran on Democracy

> Democracy is a festival of mediocrity.
E. M. Cioran


Democracy transcends time and space; it can never be understood except as a spiritual force. Majority rule rests on numbers; democracy rests on the well-grounded assumption that society is neither a collection of units nor an organism but a network of human relations. Democracy is the bringing forth of a genuine collective will, one to which every single being must contribute the whole of his [or her] complex life, as one which every single being must express the whole of at one point. Thus the essence of democracy is creating. The technique of democracy is group organization. 

Philosophy of existence, Cioran's letters—I mean the book “Letters to Wolfgang Kraus (1971 1990),” are equally, if not a greater extent, historical philosophy exercises, primarily the history of twentieth century Europe. To Cioran the future of Europe and America (it's North America) did not seem at all good. Striking is that his ideas and predictions are now, I'd say most current (and some even true) than they were in the '70s and '80s, when the 158 letters were written. It's almost a truism to say that Cioran beyond the paradoxes and the skepticism was/is a visionary. His comments on the events, which are witness statements, show a deep understanding of not only them but their effects and an intuitive medium and long term view.

In a letter dated May 5, 1973, he wrote: “Unlimited freedom they enjoy in the West is on the long term, harmful and even dangerous. Freedom has a positive value only to the extent that there are prejudices that hinder. But when prejudices are removed, the instinct of preservation is destroyed and dizziness takes over”. And this was in 1973, so two years before the Act of the Helsinki! And much more before entering the action of political correctness. It is clear that Cioran saw a dizziness that began to be felt even more acutely in the decades that followed. And not only in the countries of Western Europe.  
One sentence down on paper written by Cioran over 35 years ago seems to have been inspired by the very reality of Europe, especially today’s Romania: “In times of crisis may very well be seen the negative sides of democracy.” This is particularly troubling since I quoted what belongs to the great thinker of the twentieth century who lived in the interwar Romanian simulacrum of democracy, then a large and functional western democracy. 
Cioran senses the happening of deep motivation in contemporary phenomena and sometimes predicts on their evolution. For example, it relates to what Wolfgang Kraus, who, visiting Bucharest in 1976, was impressed that here the churches were full of believers, “Churches from Bucharest are full, but more for political than religious reasons. In any case, Marxism is the last chance of victory for Christianity. The Church must be suppressed; otherwise it becomes too conventional, too old fashioned. In the West, only one can save the ruthless tyranny”. Moreover, the fate of Christianity in the West and in Europe generally for Cioran is a reflection of the main themes and concerns, whereas Christianity has been and should remain the basis and backbone of European civilization. In January 1987, he wrote to Wolfgang Kraus: “There is no salvation for civilization that no longer believes in itself. Allow me to do a prophecy? In fifty years, Notre Dame will be a mosque.” After nearly two years, his diagnosis would be even more severe: “… Christianity is completely hollow.”

As for Romania's destiny, he did not hesitate to pronounce his opinions: “Everything in this country failed. That's the only originality.” (27 October 1990).

“Our epoch, writes Cioran, "will be marked by the romanticism of stateless persons. Already the picture of the universe is in the making in which nobody will have civic rights.” Similar to his exiled compatriots Eugene Ionesco, Mircea Eliade, and many others, Cioran came to realize very early that the sense of existential futility can best be cured by the belief in a cyclical concept of history, which excludes any notion of the arrival of a new messiah or the continuation of techno-economic progress.

When one reads Cioran's prose, the reader is confronted by an author who imposes a climate of cold apocalypse that thoroughly contradicts the heritage of progress. Real joy lies in non-being, says Cioran, that is, in the conviction that each willful act of creation perpetuates cosmic chaos. There is no purpose in endless deliberations about higher meaning of life. The entirety of history, be it recorded history or mythical history, is replete with the cacophony of theological and ideological tautologies. Everything is a historical carousel, with those who are today on top, ending tomorrow at the bottom. 

For Cioran all systems must be rejected for the simple reason that they all glorify man as an ultimate creature. Only in the praise of non-being, and in the thorough denial of life, argues Cioran, does man's existence become bearable. “I cannot excuse myself for being born. It is as if, when insinuating myself in this world, I profaned some mystery, betrayed some very important engagement, made a mistake of indescribable gravity.” The feeling of sublime futility with regard to everything that life entails goes hand in hand with Cioran's pessimistic attitude towards the rise and fall of states and empires. Although today the actors are different, the setting remains similar; millions of new barbarians have begun to pound at the gates of Europe, and will soon take possession of what lies inside: 
“Regardless of what the world will look like in the future, Westerners will assume the role of the Graeculi of the Roman Empire. Needed and despised by new conquerors, they will not have anything to offer except the jugglery of their intelligence, or the glitter of their past.”

Today there are no more utopias in stock. Mass democracy has taken its place. Without democracy life makes little sense; yet democracy has no life of its own. After all, argues Cioran, had it not been for a young lunatic from the Galilee, the world would be today a very boring place. “Society is badly organized,” writes Cioran, “it does nothing against lunatics who die so young.” Probably all prophets and political soothsayers should immediately be put to death, “because when the mob accepts a myth—get ready for massacres or better yet for a new religion.”

If a society truly wishes to preserve its biological well-being, argues Cioran, its paramount task is to harness and nurture its “substantial calamity”; it must keep a tally of its own capacity for destruction. In this area of Europe, which is endlessly marred by political tremors and real earthquakes, a new history is today in the making—a history which will probably reward its populace for the past suffering. 

“Whatever their past was, and irrespective of their civilization, these countries possess a biological stock which one cannot find in the West. Maltreated, disinherited, precipitated in the anonymous martyrdom, torn apart between wretchedness and sedition, they will perhaps know in the future a reward for so many ordeals, so much humiliation and for so much cowardice.” 

For Cioran, society becomes consolidated in danger and it atrophies in peace: “In those places where peace, hygiene and leisure ravage, psychoses also multiply... I come from a country which, while never learning to know the meaning of happiness, has also never produced a single psychoanalyst.”

If one could reduce the portrayal of Cioran to one short paragraph, then one must depict him as an author who sees in the modern veneration of the intellect a blueprint for spiritual gulags and the uglification of the world. Indeed, for Cioran, man's task is to wash himself in the school of existential futility, for futility is not hopelessness; futility is a reward for those wishing to rid themselves of the epidemic of life and the virus of hope. Probably, this picture best befits the man who describes himself as a fanatic without any convictions—a stranded accident in the cosmos who casts nostalgic looks towards his quick disappearance. 

“To be free is to rid oneself forever from the notion of reward; to expect nothing from people or gods; to renounce not only this world and all worlds, but salvations itself; to break up even the idea of this chain among chains.”
