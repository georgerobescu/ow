# Brief summary of topics

* universal basic income
* full automation
* user as production of data (which can be monetised)
* willing slave of capital
* post-humanism (fully-automatised machines are not subservient to human beings)⤵︎
* hence on what is the universal basic income based on? On user’s production of data? Meaning that also non-human and ahuman users are due a basic income?

Paradoxically, a democratic society, which is democratic only for human beings and not for machines?

Therefore slavery is considered a treat only to basic human’s rights. We are not even 100% fully composed by human-only microbes [see this example](https://youtu.be/FrNEHCZm_Sc?t=50m31s), but indeed the opposite.

Can a post-humanist-baed society be more equal and democratic than an anthropocentric one?

If a definition of the user can be one of a subject able to produce data, then should this data be processed under/through a copyright or copyleft system of sorts? E.g. what if the user willingly sells the data he she it has produced? (instead of giving it away “for free”, in exchange for using a certain product)

What about the anti-copyright stance on intellectual property, then?
→ Is this data comparable to intellectual property? (see the digital environment factor)
