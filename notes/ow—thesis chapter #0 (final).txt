## What is work

What does it mean to work when work is no longer a necessary human activity to make a living? As often “common sense” reminds us, «human beings are naturally predisposed to make things, (...)», but is it possible to compare this human predisposition to the innate desire to sustain one’s life (the spinozian conatus)? At the lowest level, do we work to claim our existence in the world?

I want to locate this very question within the framework of a post-work society, wherein work is not the main way to provide oneself with material basic needs—therefore destabilising the main point of reference in contemporary human societies (but as such since the beginning of human history): if we don’t work to make a living, then how do we shape ourselves, and how do we kill time?

An essential prerequisite of a post-work society is the implementation of a Universal Basic Income at a planetary scale level. Although changing in the amount distributed based on the geographical area of residence, an UBI should be able not to permit a decent life, but a good one.

One of the requisites to make this possible, is through a full automatisation of work, which doesn’t mean a full replacement of human beings from most jobs, but a diminishing of schematic tasks than can be done by robots (Inventing the Future, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams). This, already suggests that in the case this process toward a post-work society will happen, human beings will still be a required workforce for some (many?) jobs.

To more extensively problematise this humanist proposition, I want to connect the scenario of a post-work society with an understanding of the world through the lenses of posthumanism, drawing from its theories and slowly forming ethics, in order to reposition the human being in the world.

For example, if full automatisation permits, amongst the other interventions required, to make a Universal Basic Income possible for every human being, than how do we relate with robots? Are we enslaving them? Should not they get some value back from what they produce—if not all?

As much paradoxical or utterly dumb this question might sound, it is a line that regards human beings more and more: the fact that we are slowly becoming users, moving away, for example, from the position of citizens, unfolds the realisation that users are not only human beings, but it can be a position embodied by many other agents, different in nature.
  
If a user is anything producing data and able to interface with another source of data-maker (The Stack, Benjamin H. Bratton), then, far from being only a feature of human beings, a user can also be inhuman and ahuman: mineral, animal, machinic, algorithmic, and so forth.

**When we send an email then**,

Maybe a user is not necessarily only a direct translation of a human body into a different shell. It can either be a fraction of ourself put into a specific usage, or a combination of different agents to form a composite user.

My interest then, is located in the transformation of labour on the internet, claiming that we are undergoing a transition from the post-fordist worker [^1] subject to the internet-user subject.

[^1]: Explain post-fordist worker.

If with post-fordism we point to an iteration from mainly physical-based work (fordist worker) to predominantly a mind-based one—so we can include both intellectual and affective labor (eg. respectively a designer and a care-worker) and already making it difficult, often times, to trace a line between the two domains of labour; then with the internet user the sphere of intellectual and affective labour is the very formation of this ontological subject, completely mixing and forming one defined domain.

## github.com

The natural habitat of the user is the platform. Be it a social network, an internet-based service, or a magazine, platforms have taken upon the role of the third space next to the state and the market.

Due to my interest in labour on and for the internet, new (apparently) work paradigms, and the transformation of the post-fordist worker into the internet user, I use [github.com](https://github.com/) as my object of inquiry.

github.com is a website and a platform for users to share, contribute and download code-based projects.

github.com is a “social network” for people using `git` in their work process. `git` is a version control system for text-based files, meaning that it is a tool you install on your computer that keeps track of every change made to files within a selected folder, and lets a user review those changes.

(Consequently, `git` builds a history out of all those changes, asking a user to comment with a short description over either one single change or a bunch of them, making him active within this history-building process.)

Whereas other internet-based platforms, like Über and Amazon M Turk, are explicit in their intents to be a job-offer for someone looking for work, github.com keeps itself in the grey area of being both for personal and professional [^*] use.

In as much as a programmer working at a company can use it for their job, a weekend website-maker can use it as well for different purposes. Being `git` only an added element to one’s workflow, the reason for why then creating an account on github.com are highly subjectives, and totally in line with the spirit of the creative post-fordist worker (where famously work is play and play is work). As a user, the personal takes over the sphere of the professional [^*], transforming both into one smooth space.

[^*] using the word professional instead of the term work?
