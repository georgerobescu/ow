## From the post-fordist worker to the internet user

There still is a strong desire amongst freelance workers able to spur them to take a solo, independent career and, in doing so, avoiding to be under a boss.

Only for then being under a variety of bosses, being that a company, a client, they themselves even, and so forth.

Post-fordism arose in the early 1970s as a transformation of the current production model of the time, the fordist-method applied to the factory and, fresh of the free liberation of desires coming from the 1968, together with the application, for the first time, of neoliberal politics, repositioned in the figures of information producers and workers a new faith for the extraction of surplus value.

Common examples of these new job positions are the ones of the journalist, the academic researcher, the designer, etc.

But since the production and usage of informations means indeed the production of language, also figures like the one of the call-center worker are part of this new area. And more over, it is important to remember also all the care work area, meaning affective and emotional labour performed mainly by women in different context: waitresses and shopkeepers, care workers, nurses, masseuses, prostitutes and so on.

Affective and emotional labour are not exclusive of these jobs—they are present, in different quantities, in many other form of labour—but for sure they are the most visible and often forgotten type of employments, when talking about post-fordism.

A common element that many, if not all, of these jobs have in common is giving value to flexibility. When during the late 60s and early 70s flexibility was requested by students-finding-a-job and workers, as part of the transformations taking place in the work field, it was seen by these subjects as a positive and important achievement. They could finally manage, on their on terms, their life and work, they could set their own working schedule, they could decide to have a short-term contract and spend three months at a job, three months in another job, then other five months, for example, travelling (or fulfilling personal aspirations). Ironically, this same lust for flexibility was also happily accepted by the employers. And the capital shifted in the capturing of the workforce from the traditional one in the form of brutal, physical energy, sealed in each and every worker; to the working-desire, the desire for work they all had. The desire for self-realisation and, together with this, the energies produced through intellectual/mental labour and the one from emotional and affective labour. This passage marked a transition from the employers mainly demanding physical energy, to demand mental and affective energy on top of the physical one.

Workers were happy not to have fixed jobs. This meant going against a long tradition imposed by their family, for which you had to look out for the job of life—which was essential to build a family, a shared life, and reaching a form of stability. Instead, post-fordism introduced words such as part-time job, flexible hours, and in so doing also the idea of precarity.

For many job positions, such as, for e.g., the one of the journalist, the academic, the designer, etc. these new elements could have been taken in such a way that, after some years of paying one’s dues, they may have reached a better position at the office they were working at, or maybe even setting up their own practice. But what would have changed after five years of working at a call-center? Or as a care-worker for and with elderly and disabled people?

From the beginning of this new economy—which for the most part developed in the western world, but now can be seen outsourced to countries of the south-east Asia such as India (cfr. click-farms)—the popularisation of computers and databases were, for sure, essential elements in defining a new working environment, slowly then becoming part of society at large. 

When in 1996, Maurizio Lazzarato wrote a text on Immaterial Labour, that umbrella term was quite useful to try to define and bring to light a new iteration of what post-fordism became after twenty-five years of development.

> The consumer is no longer limited to consuming commodities (destroying them in the act of consumption). On the contrary, his or her consumption should be productive in accordance to the necessary conditions and the new products. Consumption is then first of all a consumption of information. Consumption is no longer only the "manufacturing" of a product, but a real and proper social process that for the moment is defined with the term communication.

Nowadays, that description has become obslete, because it is so embedded in the dominant societal order in which we live, that nobody is out of its reach. It is no more a specialised subset of professions for the most part contributing to this economic processes, but whoever being in some form, part of society. 

If in moving to the post-fordist worker subject, Capital began to be interested in accumulating desires—in the form of information production of some kind—while getting a bit more closer and intimate with the subjective sphere of a worker (mental labour, emotional labour, and so on); now with the internet user it is a matter of simply “living” and doing the things you do in your everyday life: the Capital needs only that to extract surplus value from your activities.

It is this the connection between post-fordist worker and internet user: data is now relevant for the Capital, not only when produced at work and for some very specific purposes, but as data itself, no matter the kind of environment in which it is born. Some value is produced out of it anyway. The precarious position often embedded within the post-fordist subject, even in the position of unemployment, now makes sense. Everybody at home can be capitalised by only browsing the internet. Home has become your phone and computer, rather than a physical fixed site. Labour has been dematerialised both in terms of time, space, and also action.

## User’s agency

(re-understanding conatus as labour in relation to computation)

Data is essential to re-understand the user subject. This position implies an expansion of the entities capable of taking part in this role, opening it up to animal, mineral, plant, machinic, algorithmic and bot user, besides the human one. Data becomes the common ground that enables human-user to interface with non-human and in-human users.

For this reason, there must be a shift at the ontological level in the language we use to talk about it: organism is incapable of including all the different natures of which the user may be composed of. What does inhuman and ahuman imply, then? Not a desire to define these other natures against the human’s one, through a process of negation with which producing a definition of each entity. Rather, it mostly helps to remind us that the human user is only one possible variant within the user position, stressing a movement of expansion that finds superfluous the connotation organic/inorganic, and instead sites in the terms ‘operative, operational’ and ‘interoperability’ a new kind of language.

It is essential to understand how this shift, from an understanding of user as a living being to one in which its way of being in the world is through data production (*being operative*), traces a line to the concept of conatus.

If conatus is «the effort by which ‘each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being» [^1], then is this still applicable to any form of user, beyond living organisms?

[^1]: Frédéric Lordon quoting Benedictus de Spinoza, Ethics, part III, in “Willing Slaves of Capital”.

What do we mean by «strives to persevere in its being» in connection to a user? Does a user strive to keep producing data and interfacing with other users, in order to avoid falling in dead, non-operative moments? Is there such a thought from the perspective of a user? Or maybe it’s not really a matter of having dead periods of time since we can compare the status of being operative as the one of being alive and breathing?

In a sense, then, the question might not be how much of an effort users have to do in order to keep striving to persevere in their beings, but rather how much they are aware of the streams of data production and interaction they are part of and, even maybe, how much they do want to acknowledge this as “effort”.

For, if with the original, spinozian definition of conatus, there is an idea of effort, comparable to an act of labour to keep staying alive; in the context of the user, labour is not always a conscious performative act, but an ever-happening activity, no matter the effort one’s put in it: it then can be channelled for a specific outcome when the outputted data is used for this or that other reason, task, aim, etc.

Being operative, in this frame, means then not being alive, or being on/off. Instead, it’s a matter of how to interface with other users and produce a different output with the convergence of two, or more, fluxes of data.

In the context of a post-work society where human users will live with a Universal Basic Income, will the idea of conatus disappear even more? Or will it change in the way it frames its significance since, with the rising and acknowledgment of many other users, human beings will have to strive to keep being relevant in their inter-operativeness amongst other peers [^2]?

[^2]: From Benjamin Bratton’s [The Black Stack](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/the-black-stack/):  
> Worse than being seen as an enemy is not being seen at all. As Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it, “The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”

Looking at it in this way then, for human users conatus will not be a matter of striving for one’s sustaining, but striving for finding new ways to interface with all the rest of users, in forms which destabilise humanist understanding of *being* in the world, of language and accountability, and so forth.

Conatus becomes a new form of labour, addressing a personal strive to stay together with others, and therefore, in how to use one’s data production to re-position oneself in the world.

(user’s agency)

How does user’s agency manifest itself, then?

Unlike one might assume, an entity (algorithmic, mineral, human, etc.) does not correspond to a user in a 1:1 ratio: a subject takes place in the user position fulfilling a set of actions, but in doing this, it is being transformed because of that very position.

To give an example: when we send an email, the user is composed by a part of us (the one thinking and writing the text, choosing a recipient, etc.) [^3], but also by the email client and the service provider.

[^3]: But then, language is not spoken by us, we are spoken by it (add reference?). So even in this action of language production, the human user is a composite user formed by a human agent and language.

For these reasons, user’s agency doesn’t correspond only to one entity’s desires, but it is shaped by many different agents, forming an array of desires and positions often visible in ways we at first don’t recognise.

For example: in recent years the tracking activities employed by many web services have become part of public opinion’s general topics of discussion. Keeping the same logic described above, it is easier to see how often the intentions we have and want to put into actions—say sending a message in which we talk about particular things—are being captured, read, processed and spitted back to us in the form of tailored ads, tracing a direct relation between the topics of our conversations and the products suggested to us.

Agency is then, like the user position, computational. Data is the common language that permits everyone taking place in the user position, to look for and create interfaces, hence languages, through which to talk and read and listen to other agents, part for example of a platform.

It is clear how, more often than not, we are part of composite users. But instead of thinking of “other users” as “other human beings”, we need to apply the word user to a more vast variety of entities that, for instance, we normally consider tools. Computation makes this easier to understand, because it transforms everything into data-readable and executable format. Conversely computation, in the process of destroying humanist values and anthropocentric orders of the world, makes no exception or favour to anyone.

There is a need for a new literacy of computation, after the failed project of cybernetics. Instead of looking for an original cosmological order, where humans and nature will find its perfect and for now lost balance, or silently praying for chaos, we have the chance to step out and aside of the current human language in use, and get closer to a variety of users in ways different than before.

Interfaces are the place where disputing how user’s agency is being read and performed. Also for this, they become integral in the redefinition of what is life, what is labour, and the transformation of these two spheres into the one of operations, operational and being operative.

`git` and github.com can be an experiment for a new literacy of computation.

(building status and building history)

Whereas oral language tends toward the creation of missing links  (black holes) in the recalling of a fact we used to know, and for this it takes over someone’s memory, computational language—even better than written human language—has a tendency to track everything. It keeps traces of what it has been processed and put them in indexes. Sure, it’s possible to edit those traces, and in so doing producing corrupted links between data sets, but that’s not the point. 

At a structural level, computational language transforms the substantive ‘archive’ into a verb. As a consequence, that’s what we began to do as well, as human users.

`git` works in the same manner, with the difference that the user has to comment after one, or a bunch of, edits performed to a set of files, briefly attesting what happened in doing those changes.

This action is called `git-commit`, and it helps to log more clearly what was updated, deleted and revised, throughout the history of a project.

This mechanism of tracking and commenting, tracking and commenting, forces the user to start adopting a particular mindset—or at least confronting him herself with a thinking mode very well defined (and maybe at odds with his her own).

`git-commit` was conceived as a useful option when working on distributed software projects (e.g. Linux), because for each new improvement or feature added to the codebase, all the rest of the team could easily see what was changed and proposed, then deciding if approving it or not.

If on its original form it works as a way to make someone responsible for his her actions, especially when in relation to a group-based project, the same `git-commit` can be used to add messages with no real connection to the work executed, and building a different, parallel history of its development.

In the context of becoming more aware how this builds one’s accountability, injecting a disconnected and ‘other’ narrative to describe a very precise but different set of decisions produces confusion and anger in the user reading it. At the same time, it’s a useful thinking to foster unwanted or non-conceived actions (using the commit text to talk in a Q&A manner with the rest of the team; doubling one’s activity between coding a website and writing a narrative about it while developing the project; etc) and free this git command from its normative function to different parameters and output. In thinking of a new literacy of computation, and using `git` as a first exploration of it, this means stretching and re-contextualising a tool built and conceived to maximise particular tasks, to push it to its most useless and deferential applications. To see where and when it breaks. To create otherness and a more varied understanding. 

What is important to remember, is that this is as well a mechanism to build one’s accountability within a project. Though on github.com users don’t receive marks of any kind (points, or stars, or karma, and so forth), they are very much responsible in every contributions they produce. Since every commit is viewable by anyone accessing the url of that project (except for when a repository is private, but that’s almost never the case for projects users want to spread around), with this action it’s possible to see what happened in the development of a project and when, who did what and how, and which reasons were given to accomplish that.

The process of working on a project then, double binds with both the process of building a history of that project, and at the same time of building a level of accountability for each contributor who takes part in it.

As an uncommon choice for a social platform’s architecture, on github.com what appear first and foremost are lists of project repositories, then users working on them. With this shift in the order and visibility of a user, also comes a reverse of hierarchy in the content order of the website: the work is of utmost importance, users are tiny bits humming in the in-betweens.

github.com’s personal user page nonetheless, has become a portfolio website for many developers, and also for designers dabbing primarily with code (though not only). Much better than any linkedin profile, a github’s user page adamantly reports number of user’s projects created, number of projects that a user has contributed to, popularity of his her projects across the github community (or should we call it group of users? Is there any real bind per se on github?), and complete activity (hours, number of commits, project history, issues, pull requests, ... ) for every project.

Better than any punching-card and office supervisor together could ever do, a user is voluntarily tracked by `git` and actively fills in any useful (or just any) detail left blank for him her to complete.

This sort of platform engagement, is what makes github.com and `git` two products which are becoming to be accepted, used and modified (in its praxis’s orthodoxy) also by non-coders—primarily by designers and writers. An expanding user-base makes a particular thinking and working mindset being adopted by different people. The tension produced by stretching defined modalities of making use of `git` and github.com from their new users adopters, is also what might foster the beginning of a new literacy of computation.

Not because it makes both tools more human or less tech-savvy, but on the contrary, because it could be a start to face data production and computation for what it is—a new shift in the making and understanding of the world; while at the same time getting a better sense of what implies to take part in the user position.
