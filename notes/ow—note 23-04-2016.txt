*(notes from last night after a round of three IPAs before dinner, as soon as I lay on bed to sleep)*

Rehabilitation center from work as it is now to a different understanding of it (computational, operational).

I commit, therefore I exist: productivity not based on worker him-herself but on amount of labour done and outputted (commits on different projects).

Productivity based on engagements with repositories.
Users become secondary because whatâ€™s at the forefront is the work itself, the repositories, the commits, and so forth.

Data and computation
are my teeth and legs,
I can run anywhere
and bite, process
regurgitate, deploy.

Some lines to create a never-ending mantra-litany to perform as a song at the exhibition (to give the mood?).
