# arachne.cc and git history

I want to expand the possible idea to use arachne's git history to carve out a narrative of how the project developed and my personal experience with it: how do you follow the outlines of a technical series of data (short text snippets) and transform them in the outlines of emotional and affective experience of a worker?

I wonder if I'll be able to reconstruct the project development or how many black holes there will be. Moreover, the act of using a particular kind of informations to tell something adjacent but completely different to it, as it is write an emotional narration of the personal experience of the projectâ€”not the work itself anymore but the subjective experience of one of the people involved it.

Still not sure if it's gonna be just a text piece, mixed with some pictures, or something more: e.g. systematically using screenshots of the email exchange me and Dorothy had, to expand the narrative elements to a direct human-to-human kind of experience.
