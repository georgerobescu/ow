# Federico Campagna video interview—notes

## Ivan

### 1

the rephrasing of the initial question between the black screen and the hovering screen doesn't seem intentional. is it? 

it seems to act as a reminder that he is taking a very long time to answer the question, indeed, i'm not sure that he has the answer

maybe the text could even fade in and out, like passing reminders of the place of departure

the strength of language is very high - metaphor as taking illustratory prominence. funny how language of metaphor hijacks the driness with which he speaks

is it too much work to re-level the coughs in the audio so they are less intense? or did you tune them up to complexify the relations of his thoughts to his body, which betrays itself in presentation?

are you trying to disappear?

the definition of 'work' is not something we can assume, is it? perhaps you can be more specific about the context of the interview, or somehow 'situate' it (and you know i don't mean as a designing democracy blah blah, more identifying certain conditions that the conversation took place under?) i'm finding myself irritated by the types of assumptions that his vocabulary implies, a type of understanding of our shared - - -... i wish for his loose use of 'political', 'neo-liberal' etc etc to somehow have an accountability rather than a sense that it's bro-talk... maybe that's not a valid desire, sorry

is the lack of alignment in the cut of image and sound to do with how i'm watching it, or is it deliberate?

### 2

phrasing of question on black background is a strange sentence

was your question letting mantra be interchangeable with worship? i haven't read the book.

it's nice how he begins responding to your question - would you consider restructuring answer orders?

still not totally convinced about the imposition of your question on his body...

i guess he's kind of cute

it's nice to see his explaining of technics

i like to watch his hands

omg this cough

hmm thinking about the nuance between your use of his her and his use of himself herself

'obsession with identities' : - (

### 3

back 2 the adventurer

is there a section of interview where he actually speaks about the book or is it always a type of invisible object

i'm now reskimming your  git-embodying-embodying-git

shame he didn't try to find this symbolic word - a symbol in a minute. wish he had attempted, i really wish he had

wish i could see you as interviewer, to have eye contact between you

what does he really mean by the ineffable dimension of life?

now i'm thinking about that dumb lanthimos movie, the lobster

so, is an adventurer an escapee?

wish muslim/islamic worlds and christian world of reformation was more fully developed

can't he now locate this conversation with a stance on jerusalem? and the complexity of that situation?

### 4

performing competitions?

adventurer in your q again. this is maybe at the core of what i see as a space between the identification of what an 'individual' might actually be, beyond a human being, which i feel like you're pointing at in your questions but his answers don't quite allow to stay present?

still confused about what he actually means by the machinic in humans

### 5

once again i'd wonder if you want to re-order the questions.

did he have the opportunity to prepare thoughts on each question beforehand? is he responding in real time? maybe it's generous to let there be a time marker of the interview footage.

not sure i get where he's going with his definition of work,deals with messy labelling and semi-commodification. shouldn't this come back to what he is talking about with worship and the role of that in 'humanity' - shifting to be one's work

i like the sirens and motorcycle from before

ahh shut up, this guy is so annoying

### 6 

who's 'people', what's universal. i mean, of course i know but i want to poke him for his authority
health - integration, not sure how fleshed this is

### 7

if he's going to talk about etymology and language in q5, well, the latin and italian, right?

unresolved linguistics. i've almost forgotten what he means by technics. is it technics or technic?

i'm confused

i'm not sure if this has resolved itself

does he write in italian?

* * * 

so for sure, lots of interesting content, but the way you've edited it seems to place him *for me at least) in a position of undue authority

he so consistently skirts around the questions that i'd wonder if it's even valuable to have them there, particularly as text hovering

## Genevieve

* make general summary of the interview (what this is? why did you want to make it? why does have to exist, why is it relevant? why with him? Two paragraphs max (in the description and on the video—also as voice over—give context about terms used and book and him)
* more cuts
* get rid of questions and use keywords (or make questions shorter—couple of lines)—remake then around the answers not the other way around
* get rid of binary question and of pronouns he she it
* get rid of posthuman and ethics
* think about themes into which to re-arrange all material
* 5 mins clip around themes that repeats (eg. cut up all sentence about identity and put them together in one clip)

### question 2
* “that’s why the obsession with identity is reoccuring now” not clear after a cut
* explain the innefable

### question 3
* accountability is understood by Federico with legitimacy in reference to life, existence and linguistics

### question 4
* solidarity and reduction of life?

### question 5
* multitude in reference to the opera and being inter-operative, opera and processing

# question 6

## Benoît

Good sound, good image. Nice light.

I'm not sure about the value of my comments because I don't know the context in which you'd like to put this video (will there be a text introduction, what is your targeted audience (because even if you might say there isn't, there is), and what is your aim with this (creating a space for Campagna to express himself and give visibility to his thought, try to explain something specific related to your own work through his voice?; in this sense how much are you part of this interview? We don't hear your voice, but at the same time this was part of a bigger project on which you worked, so I'd be curious to understand your relationship with this work, is it personal (you had your own question) or not so much?).

Introduction to your own work beforehand?
Presentation of yourself?

First question doesn't follow what Frederico says at a certain point, might not necessarly be a problem, but can be.
What is this adventurer squanderer you are talking about in your question?

The sound cut between the interview parts and the black screens with question is too bad, you should keep a continuous flow of sounds (ambient sound in between two interview parts instead of a cut between the light buzzing of space to litterally no sound, but maybe that's a choice).

I'd rather put titles and subtitles than this question that can become sometimes irrelevant.
I feel the questions and the answers can be off to each other (even though he always go back to your question and answers it, so that's probably not a problem.
Or at least I'm partly doubtful about this interview format you're using (always using question marks etc.) when we don't hear you anymore and it's this weird inbetween, he's clearly referring to you, and we can feel your presence while not being asserted. And I'm wondering if it might not be more efficient to rethink the parts by, perhaps in the first part of his answer use a simplified version of your question (like you did) and then maybe try to create parts by trying to go through his thread of thought?

24:40 Maybe you could try to lower that scooter sound?

(((Needs cut, work of typography?
Maybe some experimentations around
Illustration videos?
Have you considered summing up main ideas in a way or another?))) Well I thought about that at first, but then after getting in the video I appreciated its simplicity.

What is the thread of this discussion?
(I do understand it by looking at the interview, but I guess it'd be nice to have some first small description or explanation, maybe even explaining how he will go through the themes you talked about during this interview; maybe you'd feel that'd be taking too much the viewer by the hand, but I think that the opposite is also problematic).

Should the explanation be *fully* outside of the video?
This goes down to the question of the context in which you want the video to be, if this is a standalone, then I think it will suffer from it's absence of context (I don't think I should have to look for Frederico Campagna to understand what the guy worked about etc., but maybe I'm not the target audience).

Mostly what is saying is very clear and very good, couldn't agree more. Fully makes sense to me, very pedagogical I'd say. Which is why it's a shame the video isn't more like this also (not too much, but still a bit more). I guess I don't need to say too much about content, I don't know how much you've cut (how long was the interview at first, is it all?).

A bit of music or ambient sound, maybe during the questions?

I hope you planned bigger credits at the end for the final version, or maybe a conclusion text or something like this.
Maybe a first shot of his face, an introduction to his work or his thought in a way or another?

Why do you want it to be raw (which also means here very sharp actually), or do you want it?

Typographic detail, 30:45, question 4, penultimate line, maybe a dash between 'him' and 'her' like 'him-herself', otherwise it reads weirdly (even if I understood). Multi-gender sentences necesitate specific strategies. 

Around 43:30 he talks about the world "love" and the way it was destroyed in English etc. because it's in the "anglophone world", well it's the same in France! Hopefully we're not, French people, in the anglophone world.

30:54 maybe you could subtly lower the sound until he starts talking (but maybe you like to hear the cracks of the chair as I know you like these off-details).

48:50 Typographic detail Question 6, antepenultimate line, this last *a* should probably go to the next line (also two spaces).

My final conclusion: Good interview, very clean, informative and clear, but there's one question that I already mentioned: it all depends on the context in which it will be immersed (or the absence of context). The guy is explaining interesting things, but I feel somehow we are already fully into the subject from the first second of the video (even this "ow", I know the reference but most people won't), and this can be tough for people who end up randomly on this and feel they are missing something or that this video is (or could be) part of a bigger realm (and it was, in your graduation for example).
I'd say, how do you want to place this video in the bigger realm of things (on different scales, from your own work to other people's work, to the whole world and specific contemporary ideologies etc.)?
