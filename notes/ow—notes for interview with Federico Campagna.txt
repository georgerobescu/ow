# An interview with Federico Campagna, about the will to work in a post-work society

The will to work, in this case, is not just the will to do something but, rather, the will to survive and satisfy all the reproduction needs.

What I mean the, is the spinozist conatus to go to work in order to survive and being able to satisfy human basic needs (food, shelter, socialisation).

Federico Campagna, in his book *The Last Night*, traces a genealogy of work, especially with the replacement with God (when God died, killed by men, work became the worship-mantra activity par-excellence).

My interest in interviewing him lies in the fact that the scenario I am building as backdrop for the project thesis is post-work, posthuman one. Work stopped being the central, shaping-life activity as it is now, and instead transformed into an activity such as a hobby, or something of a personal interest. This shifting from work as less primary for one’s existence, is also due to the usage of machines to perform most of the work that can be automatised. 

Since this change in society, and a consequent shift in the importance of human beings to do work—not because they cant’ commit to it anymore, but because there is not need for it to make a living—also the sense of control over one’s life changes.

A Universal Basic Income has been established as a planetary scale, non-citizen based, disposition. You don’t have to kill yourself for 15 hours to bring home food and pay the rent.

And machines are taking care of most tasks in many jobs.

So, since this reshaping of human being’s reality, how is work perceived, especially as a cultural asset able to give meaning to a person’s life?

## Email

Hi Federico,
My name is André, I am a designer based in Amsterdam and am currently finishing my MFA in the [Designing Democracy](http://www.designingdemocracy.com/) program at the Sandberg Instituut.

My research project revolves around the transformation of labour on the internet, particularly through the turn of post-fordist worker to internet user.

Since for the beginning of my research I read your book The Last Night, and found it quite impressive in the propositions you suggest to adopt for a different understanding of work, I’d like to ask if I could interview you on these topics. 

If you’re interested in this, let me know and I’ll send you more details and some initial questions. I’d like to come to London in early May to film the interview and use it as part of the exhibition for my thesis project, but can also be flexible with timing if that doesn’t work for you.

Thank you for your consideration.

As a theoretical backdrop for the project, I’m setting a possible future scenario in a post-work, posthuman society. I’m particularly interested in how the rising of automation for many jobs, together with a planetary-scale, non-citizen based Universal Basic Income would push human beings away from identifying themselves with the work they perform daily: not because they will stop working, but because they won’t have a need to go to work in order to make a living.

I’m reading Frédéric Lordon’s Willing Slaves of Capital, and I find the concept of the (spinozian) conatus quite fascinating in this sense. The connection with the shift in importance between human beings and work is striking in my mind.

Bests,

## Questions

The interview revolves around Federico’s book The Last Night, where he presents the figure of the adventurer-squanderer and of work as a religious mantra; and my interests in the effect of the conatus toward work in a post-work, posthumanist society—where work will stop to have the centrality it has now, especially at a cultural level of “making” society.

1. In your book The Last Night, you propose the figure of the adventurer and squanderer, as a parasite “who use work as a tool to provide him-herself with all he she needs—or with all he she can take.” Would this figure still persists in the context of a post-work, Universal Basic Income-based society?
2. The shift to a post-work society includes also a shift in the conatus toward work—that is, that “innate” drive to sustain one’s life, in this case through a job. How would this influence the relationship between a worker and the activity of worship, as described in your book, that he she performs toward his her job? Would this mantra break?
3. Or would it be the opposite? A stronger and more pure mantra toward work, because less dependant on providing material needs.
4. Would the conatus toward work, as an index of one’s control over one’s life, vanish at all in a post-work society, in particular for an adventurer?
5. Finally, why should one go to work, then, if it’s not a necessary activity in order to sustain one’s life?
** to gain more money from extra activities on top of a UBI, hence delineating new class differences and persisting the neoliberal politics of “self-made man”
** to give meaning to one’s life
** to kill time with an activity, which in this case might be far from giving “meaning” to one’s life but could be only a way to pass the time

6. Since the almost total superimposition of labour on life in the internet user subject—as a constant extraction of surplus value from any possible activity one performs—how can one be an adventurer and squanderer when in this position?
7. Would you say that it’s possible to define a difference between labour and work? The former as any activity performed within a job and the latter, instead, as a general activity demanding a certain amount of energy, attention, and interest no matter the context? Or is it maybe the opposite?

*Trying again*

In your book your describe the adventurer-squanderer as a position that permits someone to escape the religious and mantra-like form of work in which we are embedded in.

As an egotist and a radical atheist, the adventurer can take anything he needs and wants from and through his job. The idea of a greater good, or of a future compensation for all the good work he has performed doesn’t exist in his mind, because part already of a metaphysical sphere.

The underlaying question I ask in my project is: if there’s no need anymore to work for a living, then would a desire for it subsist anymore?

I call this desire conatus, in the spinozian sense; precisely it is a “driving, innate, force for sustaining one’s life” in the form of work.

How would the adventurer react in the situation in which a post-work and universal basic income based society would finally appear? Would his her desires fulfilled through his her job stop to exist? Would he build a different set of ethics in this new configuration?

 *Trying again part 2*
 
 Adventurer-squanderer and:
 * conatus as work (making a living through a job)
 * conatus as mantra (persistent innate driving force to sustain one’s life through work)
 * radical atheism
 > Radical atheism should simply be a tool for those who desire to exit the systems of Promise and Religion, and to escape from the seductive grip of their chains.
 
 * is there a form of collaboration between adventurers? How this would work within a general non belief in what you refer to as “the higher purpose” of the work one does?
 * Can this form of relationship between adventurers be used to build a common platform where to act together?
> Yet, it is crucial to stress how unions of egoists are federations whose members are at the same time deeply unique in themselves and equal to each other.

 * human beings trying to imitate machines (quote passage): could a posthuman ethics stop this competition induced, often times, by fear?
> Instead of profiting from the ease allowed by a production devolved to machines, humans find themselves competing against technology and are thus forced to reduce their demands and expectations to the level of the machine. We try to work as much and as tirelessly as machines do, and by doing so we turn ourselves into second-rate production machines, never as efficient as the real ones.

* Beside money and hope, would you suggest other forms of value in a post-work society where still many people will continue to work on projects within a community? For example, forms of social recognition?
> The system of the promise, as deployed by normative abstractions, does not come without this necessary complement. Although its means of payment is not monetary, the currency which it employs is not that dissimilar in its functioning to contemporary money: hope.
> Social recognition only applies to social fictions, while one’s existential choices need the darkness of social oblivion in order to grow fully. (...) Adventurers’ desire for social obscurity informs their practices, as well as their personal aesthetics. (...) To a social environment that demands the full visual expression of oneself as a tribute that one has to pay to the ghost of Freedom, they respond with a form of visual asceticism.

* normative abstraction  
> Normative abstraction is the name that we can use to define an idea or a set of ideas which individuals or collectives place above themselves as the ultimate frame and scope of reference

* desert
> How could I think of encouraging people to abandon the poisonous environment of religious submission, if all I had to offer as an alternative was the desert of a vague freedom, of a ‘fullness of life’, which I couldn’t even explain?

## General notes for the video interview

The interview should have 3-5 solid, very focused questions, that delineate the trajectory from the current work-centred (or rather waged-labour) society to a post-work one. In doing this, the questions should point out possible fallacy or irrelevant concepts and values in use when talking about work.

The interview should last maximum 5 minutes.

Possibly, there should be 4 core questions. Then, adding other questions in order to later evaluate if they can expand the 4 basic ones in an interesting way. They could be integrated in the final edit of the interview.

More than looking for very specific answers, the interview should be the entry point toward the project exhibition. Hence, laying out basic, defining pillars that can be messed up and expanded later on in the rest of the work. Moreover, the interview doesn’t already introduce the subject of the internet user, so as an introduction it might work better—always if this will stay the introduction of the project.

But in essence, I am asking, if you don’t have to really work in order to make a living, for what reasons would you possibly do that?

How much sense would it make to edit the video adding other material on top of it (as in embodying-git)?

Then, should I be in the final edit as well, asking questions or should the question appear on screen as a way to frame and give a certain visual structure to the 3-4 core questions?
