# An interview with Federico Campagna, about the will to work in a post-work society

The will to work, in this case, is not just the will to do something but, rather, the will to survive and satisfy all the reproduction needs.

What I mean the, is the spinozist conatus to go to work in order to survive and being able to satisfy human basic needs (food, shelter, socialisation).

Federico Campagna, in his book *The Last Night*, traces a genealogy of work, especially with the replacement with God (when God died, killed by men, work became the worship-mantra activity par-excellence).

My interest in interviewing him lies in the fact that the scenario I am building as backdrop for the project thesis is post-work, posthuman one. Work stopped being the central, shaping-life activity as it is now, and instead transformed into an activity such as a hobby, or something of a personal interest. This shifting from work as less primary for one’s existence, is also due to the usage of machines to perform most of the work that can be automatised. 

Since this change in society, and a consequent shift in the importance of human beings to do work—not because they cant’ commit to it anymore, but because there is not need for it to make a living—also the sense of control over one’s life changes.

A Universal Basic Income has been established as a planetary scale, non-citizen based, disposition. You don’t have to kill yourself for 15 hours to bring home food and pay the rent.

And machines are taking care of most tasks in many jobs.

So, since this reshaping of human being’s reality, how is work perceived, especially as a cultural asset able to give meaning to a person’s life?

Hello Federico,
I’m André, a designer currently finishing an MFA at the Sandberg Instituut, Amsterdam—in a master programme called [Designing Democracy](http://www.designingdemocracy.com/).

My research project revolves around the transformation of labour on the internet, especially with the transition from a post-fordist worker subject to an internet user subject. I’m using [github.com](https://github.com/) as the object of my inquiry, to point to a possible modality and shift in the understanding of work, and at the same time to look at the platform’s politics in use on this website.

As a theoretical backdrop for the project, I’m setting a possible future scenario in a post-work, posthuman society. I’m particularly interested in how the rising of automation for many jobs, together with a planetary-scale, non-citizen based Universal Basic Income would push away human beings from identifying themselves with the work they perform daily: not because they will stop working, but because they won’t have a need to go to work in order to make a living.

I’m reading Frédéric Lordon’s Willing Slaves of Capital, and I find the concept of the (spinozian) conatus quite fascinating in this sense. The connection with the shift in importance between human beings and work is striking in my mind.

Since for the beginning of my research I read your book The Last Night, and found it quite impressive in the propositions you suggest to adopt for a different understanding of work, I’d like to ask you if you are available to make an interview on these topics. 

If you’re interested in this, let me know and I’ll send you more details and a bunch of initial questions. Ideally I’d like to come over to London in early May to film the interview and use it as part of the exhibition for my project, but if that would not be possible I’m willing to find other options with you.

Thanks.

Bests,
