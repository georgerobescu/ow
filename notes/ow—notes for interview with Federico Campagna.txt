# An interview with Federico Campagna, about the will to work in a post-work society

The will to work, in this case, is not just the will to do something but, rather, the will to survive and satisfy all the reproduction needs.

What I mean the, is the spinozist conatus to go to work in order to survive and being able to satisfy human basic needs (food, shelter, socialisation).

Federico Campagna, in his book *The Last Night*, traces a genealogy of work, especially with the replacement with God (when God died, killed by men, work became the worship-mantra activity par-excellence).

My interest in interviewing him lies in the fact that the scenario I am building as backdrop for the project thesis is post-work, posthuman one. Work stopped being the central, shaping-life activity as it is now, and instead transformed into an activity such as a hobby, or something of a personal interest. This shifting from work as less primary for one’s existence, is also due to the usage of machines to perform most of the work that can be automatised. 

Since this change in society, and a consequent shift in the importance of human beings to do work—not because they cant’ commit to it anymore, but because there is not need for it to make a living—also the sense of control over one’s life changes.

A Universal Basic Income has been established as a planetary scale, non-citizen based, disposition. You don’t have to kill yourself for 15 hours to bring home food and pay the rent.

And machines are taking care of most tasks in many jobs.

So, since this reshaping of human being’s reality, how is work perceived, especially as a cultural asset able to give meaning to a person’s life?
