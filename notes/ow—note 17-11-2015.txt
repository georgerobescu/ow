# Embodying git

Moving towards the idea of embodying and or translating git’s commands into physical representation imageries of physical activities and desires.

1. *porn & sex* or *porn & desire*  
as git’s commands can easily hint at that context ad especially it can be connected to the infamous github repo [DICSS](https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS)
2. [brogrammer](http://gizmodo.com/5910824/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-brogrammer) culture?
3. [cabinporn](http://cabinporn.com) culture?  
(pretty typical and almost cliché of the “escaping the office for the wild nature” feeling

I feel I can move away from these common imaginaries and let each git’s action (verb) decides where to go.

## Composition

1. Video of one of the selected verbs from git’s basic actions as the center and background of the video.
2. Other smaller and differently framed (different proportions and ratios) videos on top of the “main” one. Porn & sexual desires videos (or other subjects) contextually referring and expanding and building an imagery based on each git’s command.

Thinking of using my iPhone 5 to shoot the videos and using—at least as a first idea for a possible scenario—the studio and my table (laugh). Stuck, or interested, in an aesthetic of office-studio working environment, with plants, light coloured woods and white tables. Not too aseptic, not too warm and *crazy*: something, though emanating a sense of *asceticism* (not austerity).

I am thinking of that thin veil of sadness encompassing Ghost in the Shell main character, [Motoko Kusanagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Kusanagi) (especially in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence)
