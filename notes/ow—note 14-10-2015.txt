## On the current situation of the project

I'm a couple of weeks into the new (academic) year, and a couple a weeks back to Amsterdam. During the summer I tried to setup some technical stuff for the research and documentation part of the project (quite succeeding in a way, see *[_ghost-index](http://andrefincato.com/ow/ghost-index)*).

In general, though, I stopped reading and or heavily thinking about the research, both for practical reasons and also a bit consciously for taking some steps back from the that kind of rhythm.

What do I want to do in the coming weeks?

* testing out a small thought I had for a possible project: traducing and or translating *git's basic commands into physical bodily action* (performed by me or someone else) through the form of short videos (or one longer videos). I am mostly interested in the language aspect of it and in how this defines the kind of action it's going to be performed, taking into account modality, intensity, style, and so forth. Using the video format came to my mind because I wanted to reflect visually after I (or someone else) performed such actions and also because I feel like it's more a staged, and for now closed environment action, and moreover I am interested to understand or look better at this whole thing, rather than put these actions into a space of interaction with other bodies. So video it's kinda ok.
* working on a webzine about labour, gender and technology together with [Dorothy Howard](http://dorothyhoward.tumblr.com/post/131093769653/arachne-a-webzine): it's called *Arachne* and issue #1, at least, it's about labour, gender and technology. I offered my help to work together with her at the design of the website. We decided to string together simple handmade html pages, since the website it's gonna be a main page and essays/contributions. Facebook some months ago suggested me to have a look at a group called Immaterial Labor, which I did, and then she was asking if anyone was interested to help her out on this project: I suddenly replied Yes I am, what can I do, and now we are finally working on it.
* I'm gonna take part to this series of workshops and talks organised by W139 and The Side Room, called *Idiotic [Code](http://80.101.51.238/idiotic_code/)*. It is a parallel project which happens while an exhibition called [Ch'u](http://w139.nl/en/article/23402/chu/) is happening at w139 during this month and part of the next one. Idiotic Code is a «seminar spreads out over five days, [which] explores userships's technological, cultural, political and personal limitations/potentials for deviance and resistance». I'm not sure what this all means, and am working on reading a bit about what usership is, but am totally hooked up about it. This also led me to know [The Side Room](http://sideroom.org/) project space, located in a side room at [Butcher's Tears](http://butchers-tears.com/), a local small brewery close to where I (still) live right now. The Side Room is «a space for intersectional feminist, queer and anti-colonial discourse and art» and I definitely want to get involved in this project in some ways.

These are the main things going on, as a general feeling I want to make things and give theory (reading theory) less space. It's also a pretty busy period at the moment, since some client's projects are almost done but not yet, so I will push on that side as much as possible to then being able to focus more on this project.

I started to put up on the [log](http://andrefincato.com/ow) some stuff, and I overcame the feeling of "being-official" about the way things were uploaded. Now I see it more as a personal log where to annotate stuff and write down thoughts. I'm loving the fact that I can use the aside space next to the main area of the entry to comment on the thing itself, and use it as a reminder for things or as a quick way to jot-down some impressions.

Embracing the git and annotate everything kind-of-approach and put everything up on the web is part of the project itself, and now I feel less strict about it (see reaching that absolute perfectness).

As last thing: I think I am gonna try to do smaller projects and multiple, or better, a multiplicity of projects instead of just one big final project. There are some reasons behind it: the *nature* of the theme is making me thinking that this could be a better way to "tackle the issue"—e.g. looking for a fragmentary nature and for dispersion, indeed, multiplicity (in this way connecting all these fluxes) rather than an overall sense of wholeness from the beginning, with one start and one end. Then, it seems better suiting my approach right now, moving through a research in black seas, trying out small stuff, turn to another thing which seems unrelated but probably it's not. Don't want to over-theorise the whys, but I like the idea a lot. Besides the exhibition project there will be also a thesis to write, and that could be the other part to string all together these fragments and to build something else next and or out of it all.
