# Note on What is work?

*This should act as the very very introduction to the text of the thesis*.

* work as a religion
* precarity
* free labour
* self-identification, self-realisation, self-expression, selfies



> The current technological revolution need not become a race between humans and machines but rather an opportunity for work to truly become a channel through which people recognize their full potential. To ensure that we achieve this vision, we must become more specific and much faster in understanding the changes underway and cognizant of our collective responsibility to lead our businesses and communities through this transformative moment.

The centrality of work, as a way of living and of making sense of life itself, seems—is!—pervasive.

Since labour is, to a certain extent, unavoidable; and work is technically a form through which selling something (artefact, time, “talent”, etc.) and get back a remuneration for it; nowadays current situation shows a new declination of this: amongst the others, monetizable unemployment.

When the internet user becomes source-value, either through shadow work, while talking with friends, or sending an email, what does work become?

Rather than looking for a way out from work, we might instead try to bend it and create situations where it will stop having the cultural meaning it has now [April 2016]. If for most part, the kind of work we produce today is directly unpaid, non-recognized, and non-perceived as such by both parties for different reasons (eg.—company: you are simply using the product, we are customising it to you thanks to your usage; user: I’m being monetized tailor-made ads by my own usage of such product, etc), then why not relegating this activity to a less defining vector in the scale of values we have in our society?

The proposal of a universal basic income, once again after some decades from the last time it has been tried out (Canada, 1970s), pops up at the right time: free-labour could be seen, maybe, under a different light. Not as shady exploitation but as personal will, desires, interest toward doing something.

Nonetheless, an introduction such this one, brings with itself at least a couple of problem:
1. in the case technologies, for example robots, are good enough to be able to help human beings in automatising most of the processes possible, are we going to enslave them? Are they going to earn anything out of it?
2. does this new element disrupt the current socio-political situation dictated by neoliberal politics, for which every citizen is equal to any other but then thanks to his her abilities a better future is waiting for him her? Namely, what if people, on top of a basic income, are continuing to ask money for the job they keep doing?

In the first case, on one side humans will have to keep doing still quite some tasks in the work they do, including robots and automatisation in the jobs without full replacement in many cases; on the other side human’s need, or maybe hubris, to feel king of the earth, the most superior, intelligent, and able to produce thoughts, will hardly accept the fact of not showing their abilities to the same processes of automatisation they will be helped by. 

These are gross generalisation, but at least in the western side of the world, after God is dead, the only other, and way better, mantra to repeat everyday, was work. Going to work. “I didn’t do anything today, feel such a slacker”. Doing work give us the impression of spending our time in a useful, pleasant way. It gives us the impression of having some degree of control over “time” and the “future”.

In the second case, instead, it is the just mentioned feeling of having to do more, which is completely embedded in our western culture, that will not keep us away from finding things to do. Better if projects to fully occupy our heads. For fear of missing out.

A humble realisation would be to start conceiving human beings as mostly data producers as well, leveraging down the importance both of the effects and agency humanity has had over the earth (see the anthropocene discourse and this [response](https://twitter.com/FuckTheory/status/715575836733280256)), and also as a humbling down action to stop fighting against other non-human, ahuman and inhuman agents present in the world. Or better, to not feel superior because we can write books and they (the vast majority of what constitute the world) don’t.

So if labour is anyway part of an existence, unlike work, since labour is any effort made to reach a predefined outcome (eg., gardening, cleaning home, looking for a gift on shops, and so on), since it can be framed as a “labour of love”, and not a “work of love” but for sure a “work of excellence”, maybe the idea of ditching work as a central point around which building one’s life, and instead moving towards a society where work is not necessary to survive, to keep living and not starving off, it’s the direction I want to explore.

The problem happening today, is one in which we seem to get away with the idea that everything can be monetized AND friendly. The sharing economy doesn’t exist. The sharing economy doesn’t exist. 

Of course neither a well-thought, pragmatic and viable way to start implementing a Universal Basic Income that is sustainable at a planetary level, rather than only for the UK, does exist at the moment. Hence my usage of it as a trigger to ask the question: how would we perceive work in the moment it will stop being a fundamental activity to sustain basic life needs?

Work can be seen as the most hubristic act of human kind and a way to measure human’s agency over the world. But slowly human importance is going to be reframed to what it always has been: a small effect in the overall constant-changing of the world.

The expanding movement of more and more non-human agents taking part in our everyday life, both at work and in other domains (when that is possible at all), is finally reassessing what makes life and what makes the world. And how we have to begin re-thinking and shaping new ethics for this.

Hence, what does it mean to work, when work would mean really free labour? From which kind of desires is this need constituting form? Why working when there is not accumulation of capital and the value we produce would shift to something non-monetasible, but still quantifiable?
