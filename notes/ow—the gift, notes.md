# The Gift—Notes

I finished to read “The World of the Gift” by Jacques T. Godbout. After the first twenty pages I thought it was not really interesting in regard to the researches I’m doing, but I persisted anyway and I stumbled upon some good points.

The general direction of the book, of Godbout’s research, traces an underground world which at first sight isn’t really visible: form the classic reply of “she’s making a gift because she’s expecting something back, so it’s not a real gift”, to the description of the gift as an act of creation, of love, of putting in the world something new. The underlining position in doing this, is that you are not expecting the receiver to give you back something, rather, than he will make a gift you instead. This difference marks the difference from a state of negative or interchangeable debt, to one of positive debt: both the giver and the receiver turn into givers, so each of them permanently stay in a state of debt, which they will try to resolve not giving back what they got, but by making new gifts.

The book delineates several social configurations (especially the family and the relationship between husband and wife, or a love relationship), each time moving from the trading&economic point of view to the one overcoming this asset and setting itself in an endlessly state of reciprocal positive debt.
(*I might report in the future some of these examples, but for now it’s okay*.)

Another interesting point is the one concerning the element of doubt, of unexpectedness, that can occur in a relationship in which the gift appears: in the same way you’ll never be sure that the other person will make you a gift, you may be surprise by a third person accomplishing that. Surprise takes place.
And also trust: moving away from an economical-kind of relationship means that there is not contract. Because of this, trust becomes the invisible force that permits certain exchanges to be realised.

The gift is described, quite often, as that surplus of value (thanks to its state of surprise and of freedom in doing it), which put itself in a different place than if it would be a normal trading exchange: I give you something and you give me something back (contract); I give you something because I know that you will give me something back (still, a contract).

The example of the owner of a shop giving away for free a calendar to every customer in a particular timeframe is still, in Godbout’s point of view, a gift: the shopkeeper doesn’t know if any of those clients who got a calendar will return to his shop. I am actually not able to find the example on the back and check if he concluded it in a different way, because now this sounds to me quite stupid: what’s the difference then between this act and the act of investment? Isn’t this last example a coming back to the world of the economic exchange?
*Maybe I am just wrong*.

From these first considerations about the power and the multiple (multiplicity of) meanings of the gift, I’m going to read Lewis Hyde’s The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World—which might be a different take on the value of the gift inside a specific domain: work and creative labour.

The kind of extreme situation that I’m trying to push is the one in which creative almost-for-free labour might be considered, turning upside down the paradigm (or the configuration?), as a form of gift-giving. But not just for the *creative* labour, though it is easier to make, at least for me, this twist, since the very nature—and at the same time paradox—of this kind of labour.

What I am interested at the moment, then, is how much the internet gives the structure to be more willing to make gifts, and at the same time it has been used to superimpose a particular kind of architecture in reshaphing the labour-market on and through the internet.

The first examples that come to my mind are those voluntary-based websites which aggregate informations through their users, and for extensions (but not so obvious) community: e.g. wikipedia, stackoverflow, genius.

On which values are built these user cultures? How do they stay connected and how do they feel like to help the internet not matter what (really no matter what or is it unavoidable?)?

On stackoverflow and on genius users get points, based on they replies (quality and quantity I suppose). I still have to investigate on wikipedia).

I should probably investigate a bit more also the opensource culture and several communities, but would like to keep on track between labour and internet, which is not necessarily internet labour though.
