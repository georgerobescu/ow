# New thesis outline

Last updated outline was:
1. user
    * from post-fordism to internet-based usership
    * user’s agency (from God to Work, hubris)
    * the stack and the user
    * alienation (alienation and post-humanism)
2. platform’s politics
    * terms and conditions
    * git’s decentralised structure and github’s centralised one
    * universal basic income
    * intellectual property

The new one looks like:

0. introduction
    * what is work
    * what is git and github
    * on the irrelevance of democracy to understand the “situation” [^1]
1. user
    * from the post-fordist worker to the internet user
    * user’s agency
    * the stack and the user
2. platform’s politics
    * terms and conditions
    * git’s decentralised structure and github’s centralised one


To address:
* universal basic income (put it in the introduction or at the end in a new chapter?)
* intellectual property

[^1]: The “situation” is both the current one but especially a future scenario for the posthuman and the post-anthropocene. If humanity will stop to feel so central to the world, then why using democracy? Which “people” (demos)? Demos, in the best case, will be one part of the overall picture.
