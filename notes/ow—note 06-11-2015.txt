# ASMR and Infra-thin


ASMR:
> Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a physical sensation characterized by a pleasurable tingling that typically begins in the head and scalp, and often moves down the spine and through the limbs.

A list of sample videos — [http://www.asmrlab.com/common-asmr-triggers](http://www.asmrlab.com/common-asmr-triggers).

A technique to achieve this is [binaural recording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats).

Infra-thin:
> is Marcel Duchamp's word for measuring the almost imperceptible margins of difference between two seemingly identical items. Infra-thin measures the all but immeasurable interstice between two things or ideas as they transition into and between one to the other, the passage between sense and non-sense, and the delay or deferral of these passages between the senses themselves.
> For example, the difference between adjectives and nouns is infra-thin. So is the act of forgetting. Other examples from Duchamp include an object at one time and then one second later (the identity principle), the warmth of a seat that has just been left, a stare, people who go through subway gates at the last moment, the whistling sound made by velvet trousers when walking, a painting on glass seen from the unpainted side, or the space between recto and verso.
