## Post-Fordism – a Contextualisation by Igor Pribac, from Post-Fordism and Its Discontents

4. [Fordism] as a “societal paradigm” (Lipietz 1994: 341). In nuclear family households on which it was based the Fordist economy encouraged the consumption of standardised goods and services.The state assumed an important role in the negotiations between employers and employees. The tripartite negotiations between capital, labour and the state became the basis for ensuring long-term, stable conditions of production and consumption, a prerequisite for Fordist new value creation. In the case that the previous three levels of comprehension of Fordism failed to do so, this one unambiguously points to the cultural and anthropological dimensions of Fordist solutions (e.g. the priority of conformism over non-conformism).

According to the general view, in the mid-1970s this comprehensive socio-economic arrangement began to inwardly fracture and crumble.

(Neo-Schumpeterians emphasise the significance of technology and technical standards in promoting and sustaining long conjunctural waves.)

*The crisis of Fordism in the 1970s was caused by the rise of a new techno-economic paradigm and its divergence from the institutional framework that remained attuned to the conditions of the fourth cycle. Objections raised against this explanation address mainly its technological determinism: it claims the socio-political institutional framework depends on the techno-economic paradigm*.

Given that the “flexible specialisation” interpretation mistakes the high productivity of small businesses for competitiveness, the bright future that adherents of the flexible model predict for flexible economy is questionable to say the least.

[*Michel Aglietta] asserts that four distinct factors indicate the crisis of Fordism: a) diminished profitability of production activities due to labour demands and technical restrictions (problems with managing longer and longer production chains); b) globalisation of economic currents disrupting the management of national economies; c) growing share of social transfers in public spending that propels the inflationary spiral and fosters distributive conflict; d) differentiation of consumption patterns demanding a broader range of supplied use-values*.

National markets became saturated with material mass consumption goods, attempts at breaking through to foreign markets were tied to additional costs, including political ones, increasing labour demands provoked a portion of the employers to relocate production to territories with cheaper and more governable workforces and raising unemployment levels, which in turn burdened welfare budgets even further. Consequently, inflation spiralled to new heights, and the ability to ensure a satisfactory degree of general social welfare – the very justification for Keynesian state policies – dwindled.

Rather than granting workers a chance to participate in the ownership and management of companies – a credible proposal made at the time at least by social democratic parties in Europe – the solution in the U.S. favoured rerouting the employees’ surplus earnings into stock market funds, often into the ones participating in the ownership structures of companies that employed the fledgling small shareholders.The filling of these funds provided companies with fresh capital. And since the labour-shareholders had their future tied to the companies’ fate on the stock market, they were motivated to produce more, while as minority owners they were kept from co-managing the companies (Marazzi 2002: 33).

The financial crisis triggered last year (2008) is undoubtedly a milestone in this very reversal.

the thesis on the break within the self-comprehension of value and organisation in capitalist societies, to which we refer here as the transition from Fordism to post-Fordism.

In its traditional sense, industrialism is indeed linked with machine production of commodities in the primary and secondary sectors, but viewed essentially as serial production caused directly by the introduction of machines into the production process, it yields an altogether different picture. As
it turns out, a large section of the service industry is imprinted with seriality. (...) the shift from the production of commodities to the production of services was merely a transition from one form of industrial society to the next.

*The theory’s supporters [of information society] stressed not only the benefits to production, the cutting of costs and the higher level of knowledge in society, which they hoped to gain from a widespread use of digital technologies, but thought the introduction of computers into production processes and social communication would have political effects, e.g. more leisure time, increased participation in the democratic decision-making processes, and, as a consequence of the former two, the spread of deliberative democracy*.

*Leaving aside the techno-utopian dimensions of the image of computerised society and limiting oneself to the economic aspects of the information society concept, one will find that information technology has entered all production sectors – from service to manufacturing industries – and became their integral part without significantly altering the power relations within them*.

the regulationist definition of Fordism as a special accumulation and regulation regime essentially justifies the use of the term [post-fordism], since it preserves the specificity that other competing descriptions seem to circumvent – namely, the economic-social-political core of the transitional changes.

## Three Theses on Post-Fordism by Zdravko Kobe, from Post-Fordism and Its Discontents

*post-Fordism is a type of organisation that primarily answers the question of how to distribute this surplus value. (...) post-Fordism does not answer the problem of production, but primarily the problem of the distribution of wealth*.

On the other, certain occupations would need to be invented here for the ones who are excluded from the economy because their work is non-competitive. These people have a surplus of leisure time and no means to participate in the process of surplus value created in the Third World. (...) the surplus value created in the Third World should be distributed within the developed world in a way that would be acceptable both economically as well as politically.

One option is to expand the field of economic activity to areas in the developed world that are secure from the competition of the cheaper labour force from the Third World. (...) Service activities, are of this type.

A market should be created for these activities and it should also be expanded to the areas that have thus far been excluded from the economic sphere. Activities that have been part of leisure time should now be included in the economic sphere. At the same time, these activities would have to be highly valued, so that the salaries would suffice to buy goods from the Third World. Thus, it may happen that someone who is, for example, specialised in walking dogs would be ten times more productive and would earn ten times more than someone who, let's say, makes her/his clothes.

this model (...) may also overcome the problem of the so-called class antagonism (...) the opposition between social production and private distribution of wealth.

capitalist society would resolve its paradox by way of externalising its inner paradox, transposing it to some other end of the world, the Far East, for instance. (...) an external interest opposition between different countries. (...) Further, this would mean that the majority of us, living in post-Fordist societies, are not on the side of the workers within this contradiction but on the side of the capitalists.

the post-Fordist society, is principally a system of social distribution of wealth and not a system of creating wealth.

Their proposal was to do away with the strict hierarchy at the working place and in the company, to make the company more humane, to give it a human face. Capitalism with a human face – that was the project.

work should make workers feel active and give them space for self-initiative, free choice, etc. The true, new manager – as we know her/him today – should not give people directions and concrete tasks. Rather, the new manager needs to be more and more a motivator and an animator, able to fascinate the workers, win them over to partake in a joint endeavour. The ultimate goal was for people to consider their working place their second home – possibly even their first and true home.

the workers should not regard their work and their working place as an external obligation but as a place of self-realisation, the place of the enactment of their freedom, an opportunity for personal growth.

anti-capitalist movement (...) was against the standardisation brought about by the capitalist system and its mass production. (...) The movement protested against restrictions that stifle individuality and originate in the demands of the capitalist system. Instead, it demanded recognition of the multitude of diversity, personal freedom, recognition of creativity.

Desire will undermine capitalism – capitalism suppresses desire, and when desire is released, capitalism will cease to exist.

*The capitalism the [anti-capitalist] protesters fought against (...)  was the capitalism of the old spirit. (...) what was set up as an alternative to capitalist production, imagination, life, diversity, freedom, individuality, were the very features offered by the ideologists of new capitalism to form the new spirit of capitalism*.

Their demands for flexibility and occasional employment without regular pay in contrast to rigidity, became a common request within the system precisely because the modernisation was so successful. It was a demand that everyone had to accept, even those who would have preferred to work in the framework of the old conditions. Their dreams became our nightmare.

the common ideal is that everyone acts as a state in the state or, in Spinoza's words, as an empire in the empire. What was once regarded as a product of objective laws (losing one’s job, for example) and as an expression of social injustice, is today taken as the result of personal failure.

It is precisely because the internalisers, be they winners or losers, see in every choice they make – even when it is explicitly enforced – an expression of their own true nature, that they freely submit not only with individual acts but also with their entire nature.

the subject can rise toward generality only through a certain submission, through submission to the necessity of thinking and to the necessity of the thing itself.
