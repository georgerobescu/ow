# git-embodying or git-embodied

A process of alienation as a way to understand labour (within the transition from post-fordist worker to user) in a different and collateral way.

`git` as a language to bridge human beings to other form of users, and moving `git` away form being it used and understood only in reference to work (part of a workflow)—since work will not be the same as we conceive it now—to a general approach toward life (living one’s life).

Human beings only one of the agents forming the user position.
