# embodying-git, git-embodying

* how git and github affect the *body* of the *users* making using of them
* human-user, bot-user (for now no other user, but possible to expand it)
* selection of basic git-commands (actions, counteractions, reactions, effects)
* *body* as data, and data as the common ground through which interfacing with different users and also understanding one’s body (or one’s own)
* avoiding the approach of taking the machinic-bot position and use numerical-based vision of reality (digital is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., not only 0 and 1)
* human→bot→bot’s vision→human consciousness)
* but rather staying in one’s own body (eg. human body) and try to unfold new levels of reality, and also same ones but differently
* human→data→information e deformation of human’s vision and consciousness)
* no replacement and taking the perspective of (...)
* rather becoming other and let oneself being informed and transformed by computational data to the extend of one’s body
* *computational data* as labour→processing as *conatus*
* *conatus* as a striving to interface with other kind of users with different nature, on the base of computational data
* *conatus* as a striving towards becoming other? or getting enough out of oneself in order to be bale to interface with a user of different nature?
* so then: each psychomotor action demanded by a computational command produces a: 
    * site and moment of thinking like a machine?
