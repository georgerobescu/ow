post-prism.net reflects on recent discussions on internet surveillance and the user's privacy with a set of speculative and experimental online tools.
Each of these tools transforms a well-known everyday online activity into an experience of irritation and subversion illustrating what different modes of publishing, production and sharing could look and feel like.

This course explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and self representation as mediated by technology. We will investigate ways that technology can be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way.

Laborers of Love is a project focused on the relationship between online sex and online work, specifically how technology mediates desire and sexuality. We are interested in how online culture has transformed what we mean by labor, sex, gender, sexual preference and collaboration, as well as how we think of pornography in terms of production and consumption.

Networked Optimization is a series of three crowdsourced versions of popular self-help books. Each book contains the full text, which is however invisible, appearing as white text on a white background. The only text that remains readable is the so-called popular highlights – the passages that were underlined by many Kindle users – together with the amount of highlighters. Each time a passage is underlined, it is automatically stored in Amazon’s data centers.

Contra-Internet describes the emerging militancies and subversions of “the Internet.” Comprised of multiple series, Contra-Internet critiques the Internet as a hegemonic descriptor for digital networking and premier arena of political control, as well as documents and speculates upon network alternatives that social movements are developing globally, such as autonomous mesh networks, encryption tactics, and darknets. Inspired by the transgender theorist Beatriz Preciado’s Manifesto contrasexual, Contra-Internet is oriented from a feminist and queer perspective, in an effort to unite such political positions with a hacker ethos. Contra-Internet aims to function as an expansive conceptual, practical, and experimental framework for refusing the neoliberal logic of “the Internet” while building alternatives to its infrastructure.
