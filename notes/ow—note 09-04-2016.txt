# embodying-git

Embodying-git, once born as a video series, is now moving toward, also, a zine in the form of a dictionary, a user-manual, and a general translation of git within the greater general world (eg. using metaphors to explain some git-commands into other actions)? Is it?

The zine will focus on the basics of git and the repercussions and influence on the user:
* basic git-commands
* git’s dynamics and architecture (master repository, branches, submodules)

Screenshots and processes.

A comparison between The Stack multi-layer structure and git’s multi branch and submodule structure.

For each git-command a counterpart physical-bodily action.
