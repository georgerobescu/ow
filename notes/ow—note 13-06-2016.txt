# ow zine

*What is the purpose of the zine*?

The zine acts as a mixture of text and pictures, to further expand the idea of *embodying-git—git-embodying* that I am talking about both on the thesis (sketchily) and in *ow—drawing cursor*.

It is for me a way to properly talk about how, for “a new literature of computation”, `git` might be used and employed, even in absurd ways, to test and see how it would be to use this tool in contexts different from its intended purposes.

Whereas the texts serves as exploration of these ideas and I will draw from my own notes and thoughts, pictures could be of a different kind: they can be assemblage of pictures I took somewhere and, modified and recontextualised; or prepared anew from scratch.

The only reason I am thinking of the former option, is because last December, I took some photographs of a magazine which was featuring and article with tips on how to keep your body fit when spending your whole day at an office (this was long!). There was a woman making physical exercises using desk offices, printers, office steps etc. as props. The first and strongest reaction I had when looking at it is that it was portraying quite well what used to be (we might say already?) the post-fordist worker (chic) at its best.

This would help, again, to trace a transition between this figure and the one of the internet user?

Otherwise, beside text, which kind of pictures should I make?
