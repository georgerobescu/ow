1. Interview with Federico Campagna in London went really well. Have more than one hour of dense and pleasant conversation with him.
2. Think I figured out how to display two of the three projects for the exhibition, not sure about the third because I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it on time. The other two use a table and a chair for the display of the artefact (in one case a chair on top of a table, in the other a table leaning on the side on a chair).
3. Got really tired and sick the past three days, moving between moments in which I am anxious as fuck and other in which I could not care less and am fine with what I’ll be able to present. Monday thesis deadline and still have to write conclusion chapter and fix the three other chapters (~8000 words). LOL.
4. Keep telling myself this project is a first general sketch for then starting to make more projects within the topics I am touching upon on the thesis. It calms me down some days, it makes me mad on others.
5. Didn’t write in here since a while, it’s Saturday evening, 21.55 (28-05-2016). Making rooibos tea and not the usual green because needs to sooth my body for tomorrow. Need to calm down.
