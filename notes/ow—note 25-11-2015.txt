Ivan said Metahaven likes to be in the prison they chose to be in. Almost as if they looked for that prison, or as if they made the prison visible.

The prison is design. I think.

Ivan was saying, as he did other times, that “design can do anything”. Of course he was making fun of it, something I agree with. Still, I don’t think Metahaven sees design like that. And the fact that they chose to be in a prison if indeed a way to liberate design from this mantra of “design can save the world—design can do anything”. Still, when you hear, and also last evening it happened at the preview & talk of Metahaven’s latest work in progress, a film, that design, instead of solving problems and giving solutions, simply designate (to designate ≠ to design), it just shows what’s happening at a particular problem, I feel nonetheless with a big sense of nausea. Because it avoids once more to inscribe what you are doing through design, within a particular context and or discourse: are you serious?

It’s definitely necessary to empty the word design out of all this heavy rhetoric of “it can do anything, it improves the world around us, it is a positive and empowering force for everybody”. Still, I’m not sure that “simply showing how things are” is enough to move away from the current, almost mono, proposition that design finds itself in and find new horizons for it.

Quoting Sir Jersey Seymour:  
> design as a force of agitation

Indeed, also.
