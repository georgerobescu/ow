## What is work

If until thirty-five years ago avoiding work was possible, because it still hold a division from ones’ personal life, now how can you do that when browsing the internet almost inherently produces some kind of surplus value for the company of the service you’re using?

The sentence “Against Work” [^0] comes really from a different composition of the world.

In spite of this, or because of it, work has never been so central, both to the shaping of our life and to the discourses we produce [^1] through language, than before. “I’m busy with something, I can’t hang out this evening/weekend” has become a new standard answer between the people hanging around in the “creative” sector [^2].

What is work nowadays?

For many reasons it seems inescapable not because we all have a jobs, but precisely for the opposite: unemployment and precarity are not a moment of passage and an exception, but, for the last twenty five years, constituent situations of the western societies. Despite this, labour comes to us, for example in the form of metadata production or shadow work (think about the supermarket’s self-checkout).

What we are living through is a transition from the post-fordist worker to the user-subject. 

The former happened at the end of the 1970s when neoliberal politics kicked-in and began to govern many countries. With it flexibility, self-governance, accountability and, as a result, precarity, became essential features of the worker. A rise in information technology and the service sector, produced an increased “working class” including designers and call-center receptionists, to care workers, and encompassing both affective and intellectual labour within its body of jobs.

The latter, the user-subject, slowly unfolds itself since fifteen years as a long iteration of the former, shifting the workplace from the office and or the studio and or the atelier to internet platforms (eg. social networks) and to internet as an over-arching platform.

In this shift, affective and intellectual labour merge in one subject, that in fact takes the shape of the user. Both these two sets of mansions (or tasks, or actions) are formative part of the user subject, in that leisure (the personal) is not only mixed with labour (a job)—as it happened with the post-fordist subject—but, in most cases, the personal takes over the sphere of work as it transforms it into one’s labour.

The risk then is that, as much as “everything is political”, everything turns also into labour.

What I am curious to explore is how this shift might be position within a different socio-economico and political reality where the current cultural understanding of “work” has disappeared and labour has taken its place completely.

How does one relate to work, meaning to a job, when there’s none anymore? If labour can be used to refer to an extensively range of activities, most of which are do out of necessities, personal interests, love, friendship, or an inherently natural human drive toward “making things”, then which kind of ethics would appear as a replacement to the current work ethos?

This new scenario is built around a planetary scale implementation of the Universal Basic Income, and draws from posthuman philosophies to reposition the human agent in the world and as one of the actors as user-subject

[^1]: Or the discourses we are shaped by, as in language speaks us and we are spoken by language.
[^2]: Then paradoxically many other people have to work three jobs to be able to sustain their life.

## git and github

The natural habitat of the user is the platform. Be it a social network, an internet-based service, or a clothing brand, platforms have taken upon the role of the third space next to the state and the market.

My object of inquiry is [github.com](https://github.com/), a website and platform, where users can upload, share, download and contribute to each other’s projects they have uploaded.

Github.com is a “social network” for people using `git` in their work process. `git` is a version control system for text-based files, meaning that it keeps track of every change made to files within a selected folder, and lets a user review those changes.

Consequently, `git` builds a history out of all those changes, asking a user to comment with a short description over either one single change or a bunch of them, making him active within this history-building process.

`git` was designed and developed by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created Linux, as a free-software replacement to the version control system BitTorrent, a proprietary application.

For these reasons, `git` was conceived for software developers and anyone dubbing with code. Nonetheless, it works well also with prose-text.

Whereas other internet-based platforms like Über and Amazon M Turk, are explicit in their intents to be a job-offer for someone looking for one, github.com keeps itself in the grey area of being both for personal and work use.

In as much as a programmer working at a company can use it for their job, a weekend website-maker can use it as well for different purposes. Being `git` only an added element to one’s workflow, the reason for why then creating an account on github are highly subjectives, and totally in line with the spirit of the creative post-fordist worker (where famously work is play and play is work). As a user, the personal takes over the sphere of work, transforming it in one smooth space.

# draft #2

## What is work

What does it mean to work when work is no longer a necessary human activity to make a living? As often “common sense” reminds us, «human beings are naturally predisposed to make things, (...)», but is it possible to compare this human predisposition to the innate desire to sustain one’s life (the spinozian conatus)? At the lowest level, do we work to claim our existence in the world?

I want to locate this very question within the framework of a post-work society, wherein work is not the main way to provide oneself with material basic needs—therefore destabilising the main point of reference in contemporary human societies (but as such since the beginning of human history): if we don’t work to make a living, then how do we shape ourselves, and how do we kill time?

An essential prerequisite of a post-work society is the implementation of a Universal Basic Income at a planetary scale level. Although changing in the amount distributed based on the geographical area of residence, an UBI should be able not to permit a decent life, but a good one.

One of the requisites to make this possible, is through a full automatisation of work, which doesn’t mean a full replacement of human beings from most jobs, but a diminishing of schematic tasks than can be done by robots (Inventing the Future, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams). This, already suggests that in the case this process toward a post-work society will happen, human beings will still be a required workforce for some (many?) jobs.

To more extensively problematise this humanist proposition, I want to connect the scenario of a post-work society with an understanding of the world through the lenses of posthumanism, drawing from its theories and slowly forming ethics, in order to reposition the human being in the world.

For example, if full automatisation permits, amongst the other interventions required, to make a Universal Basic Income possible for every human being, than how do we relate with robots? Are we enslaving them? Should not they get some value back from what they produce—if not all?

As much paradoxical or utterly dumb this question might sound, it is a line that regards human beings more and more: the fact that we are slowly becoming users, moving away, for example, from the position of citizens, unfolds the realisation that users are not only human beings, but it can be a position embodied by many other agents, different in nature.
  
If a user is anything producing data and able to interface with another source of data-maker (The Stack, Benjamin H. Bratton), then, far from being only a feature of human beings, a user can also be inhuman and ahuman: mineral, animal, machinic, algorithmic, and so forth.

**When we send an email then**,

Maybe a user is not necessarily only a direct translation of a human body into a different shell. It can either be a fraction of ourself put into a specific usage, or a combination of different agents to form a composite user.

My interest then, is located in the transformation of labour on the internet, claiming that we are undergoing a transition from the post-fordist worker [^1] subject to the internet-user subject.

[^1]: Explain post-fordist worker.

If with post-fordism we point to an iteration from mainly physical-based work (fordist worker) to predominantly a mind-based one—so we can include both intellectual and affective labor (eg. respectively a designer and a care-worker) and already making it difficult, often times, to trace a line between the two domains of labour; then with the internet user the sphere of intellectual and affective labour is the very formation of this ontological subject, completely mixing and forming one defined domain.

## github.com

The natural habitat of the user is the platform. Be it a social network, an internet-based service, or a magazine, platforms have taken upon the role of the third space next to the state and the market.

Due to my interest in labour on and for the internet, new (apparently) work paradigms, and the transformation of the post-fordist worker into the internet user, I use [github.com](https://github.com/) as my object of inquiry.

github.com is a website and a platform for users to share, contribute and download code-based projects.

github.com is a “social network” for people using `git` in their work process. `git` is a version control system for text-based files, meaning that it is a tool you install on your computer that keeps track of every change made to files within a selected folder, and lets a user review those changes.

(Consequently, `git` builds a history out of all those changes, asking a user to comment with a short description over either one single change or a bunch of them, making him active within this history-building process.)

Whereas other internet-based platforms, like Über and Amazon M Turk, are explicit in their intents to be a job-offer for someone looking for work, github.com keeps itself in the grey area of being both for personal and professional [^*] use.

In as much as a programmer working at a company can use it for their job, a weekend website-maker can use it as well for different purposes. Being `git` only an added element to one’s workflow, the reason for why then creating an account on github.com are highly subjectives, and totally in line with the spirit of the creative post-fordist worker (where famously work is play and play is work). As a user, the personal takes over the sphere of the professional [^*], transforming both into one smooth space.

[^*] using the word professional instead of the term work?

## On the irrelevance of democracy to understand the “situation”

What is the link with democracy?

I think this question highly collides with a scenario where posthuman ethics, in particular toward work, take over.

Democracy has always been concerned by governing human beings mostly and foremost, then all the rest comes—slowly, if we care.

I think that democracy as a political framework to understand the current situation is a suggestion to pursue a position of blindness. Especially for a possible future scenario where work is no longer a central human activity anymore, at least in the way that culturally we perceive it nowadays.

Social democratic policies after WWII defined full employment as the strategy to build a better, more prosper, wealthier and healthier society. It worked for while, then the oil crisis in the 1970s began to crack in and social welfare started to slowly fall apart.

From there on neoliberal politics took place, ironically using the stakanovist image of the stalinist Russia as the ideal to make pursue to the then rising post-fordist worker. Flexibility, self-governmentality, precarity.

At the heart of a democratic state, there seem to be the promise of “creating” new jobs as one of the central point to then build all around the rest of a society.

The first of the two sentence [First Article of the Italian Constitution](https://www.senato.it/1025?sezione=118&articolo_numero_articolo=1) says:

> L'Italia è una Repubblica democratica, fondata sul lavoro.

“Italy is a Democratic Republic, built on labor.”

If we want to move away from a humanist, labour-based form of society, where everything is under control of, or made for, human users, and try to articulate a different understanding of what life can be, democracy is something to let dying.

By “situation”, I refer to a composite scenario where the current order of things, dominated by the headline “democracy is broken”, is superimposed against a backdrop where a different context made by a post-work, posthumanist society takes place.

## On the irrelevance of democracy to understand the “situation” (#2)

My disinterest in democracy as a framework to understand the situation is twofold:
1. the centrality of work as the main value of (social-)democratic societies around which to make function all the rest (but first, let’s aim to full-employment, whether for real as in the fordist factories, or as a promise/threat, as under the neoliberal regime for post-fordist autonomous workers—24/7 availability)
2. the embedded humanist values present in such a political framework, in particular since *democratic values* refer to western european countries where the “majority” is pictured by a white, adult, cis-male, able-bodied, middle-class, person. This person, consequently, exemplifies at best what a good citizen is and have to be: a full position of privilege.

For as much as democracy tries to take into account minorities, it often produces enormous disasters: think about the idea and multiple experiments with culture integration. A way to normalise and dumbing down someone’s else culture, in order to make it digestible for the society it is in.
