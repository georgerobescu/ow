It’s been a while since I am writing here, and I also had quite different thoughts and ideas to track down.

Let’s go brutally with a list:
1. research question’s definition: in a possible future where work would be unnecessary as a basic function to keep going on living (see [Inventing the Future](http://andrefincato.com/ow/inventing-the-future-postcapitalism-and-a-world-without-work)), what would it be the repercussion to the labour happening on the internet and for the internet, in particular to the “maintenance work”?
2. refined more and more what kind of elements I want to use in the embodying-git’s videos (such as a short voice over introduction, and mixed with material captured in the physical world, lots of screencaptures of my computer; using snippets of J.G. Biberkopf’s Ecologies album); working with associations.
3. ???

On a different note, quite far away from the research project itself, and more about personal considerations regarding my staying in Amsterdam: 
1. I came to realise how much I am interested in practicing writing as a new tool and space of action in and for itself. Together with the practice of observation and of thinking, I want to use writing as a way to get lost and find myself in different places I could not have reached if it wasn’t for me vomiting down written words on a screen and on paper.
2. I am very excited to work on the [arachne](http://arachne.cc)’s project, both because it’s quite related to my general research, and also because it gives me the chance to get in contact with new people and in parallel to be a working actor within the project—with the possibility to reflect on what I’m doing for research purposes as well.
3. For as much I am concerned in developing a project (or series of projects as I was planning at the beginning of the year), I am more and more convinced that using this time to start as many different and not necessarily related projects to the master programme is as good if not a better approach than I initially thought. Meaning that these two years are opening me up to different possible scenarios and the master project is just one of the different things I am into. To go back to the interest in cultivating writing as a necessary tool to make things, if I had to just look at what writing is giving me in regards to the research project, I would say it is making me wasting mostly time—time that I should spend in producing more visible things. Yet, I just see this direction towards writing that I’ve taken one of the best things I could possibly do, since I am improving my skills (lol at the skill-classes by XML).
4. I decided to translate into English the workshop “salvaschermo” since, first of all because I am almost never in Italy, I won’t have that much time to invest in it in an Italian context. But I am very much looking forward to keep working on it and present it somewhere in The Netherlands. It’s a different project from the one I am doing for the Master, but it could be seen as a possible output of it or also as a parallel thought beside work (or together with work, as long as some of the topics I am touching upon in the workshop can be seen as work). Anyway, something I’d like to make happen this year. I tried last Summer but with very time and several problems along the way it failed.  Try again, try again.

## embodying git

I am ready to start to play with the first video out of the six I was thinking of making, since I reached a good-enough point where I more or less know what kind of elements I want to put in it.

Last night I decided I want to use snippets of J.G. Biberkopf’s latest albume, *Ecologies*. I already saved a quote from him some weeks ago:

>> He says of the project’s inception, that he was intrigued by an oddly “naive idea of nature that seemed strikingly prevalent in my social environment.. I was curious to know how these simulations of Nature work in digital media, how do we do experience these simulated materials”.
>> [J.G. Biberkopf](http://www.k-n-i-v-e-s.com) about his album “Ecologies”

> Similarly, my interest with this video (probably “these videos”) lies in the explorative dimension of how much git influences a certain way of working, thinking, acting, moving, and so forth. Hence, which kind of imaginaries does it provoke in one’s mind? Which kind of associations when thinking about `git-init` or `git-commit` or `git-push`?

The videos are not turning into music videos, or picturing *Ecologies*’ track list, rather I want to see if they could be a good layer in the creation of a particular mood for the videos.

### git-init

> `git-init`, create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one.

#### Description

> This command creates an empty Git repository—basically a `.git` directory with subdirectories for `objects`, `refs/heads`, `refs/tags`, and template files. An initial `HEAD` file that references the HEAD of the master branch is also created.

> If the `$GIT_DIR` environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of `./.git` for the base of the repository.

> If the object storage directory is specified via the `$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` environment variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath—otherwise the default `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory is used.

> Running *git init* in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for rerunning *git init* is to pick up newly added templates (or to move the repository to another place if --separate-git-dir is given).

Two small windows are showing 1) the git-init command (`cd` into desktop; `mkdir` a new folder called “embodying-git”; `cd` into it; perform `git init`); and 2) a file manager app (Transmit) moving into the new created folder to show the .git folder (which is a hidden folder, hence impossible to see using Finder.app, whereas with Transmit.app it’s possible to show hidden files and folders).

What’s the main action performed by a human body? Some hidden folder to keep tracks of other non-hidden (main?) folders are created to build as the skeleton of the tracking tool:
* cutting big green leaves with a small knife
* cutting an avocado in two and sucking the pit
* setting up one’s own working table
* diving into water with a rope
* cutting one’s own arm in order to prepare oneself for the transformative process coming soon
* making one’s hair: using a comb, fix them with a hair elastic bracelet
