# Embodying git, after the second tutorial with Julika

Tried to explained her, or better, to put on the table all the materials and thoughts about the “embodying git”’s videos and she came up with the idea of “versions”.

Specifically, of using different kind of cameras to film the same scene and then use them all together (as I told her, in this multilayered way of superimposing, or stacking, different videos on top of each other—in my mind one background video with the main action and then all around other smaller frames with different connected material).
