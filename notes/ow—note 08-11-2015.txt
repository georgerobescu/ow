# From ASMR and Infra-thin to Embodying git

[I originally (lol the word origin) put the below words after some quotes about ASMR and infra-thin, as a commentary and first thoughts about the two new materials I found—I then decided to put this thoughts in a separate note because I am slightly OCD]


Referring to ow—note 06-11-2015.txt, some thoughts about ASMR (Autonomous sensory meridian response) and infra-thin.

It is from these two different kind of sensations that I would like to go on and try to think about a series of videos, for now called "Embodying git": 
* how can you translate git's basic command into corporeal actions? 
* how much the meaning of each word (software command) does influence the way you perform that action? 
* in which kind of environment do you accomplish these actions?
* and with which kind of materials?
* do they directly translate into symbolical or didactical objects and action, to easily mimicking the software counterpart or
* is there a way to get away from that and make use of different materials?
* what if it's possible to *hack* (such a horrible empty word it is becoming) into already existing everyday actions (like brushing your teeth?)

Why do I find this extremely sensorial stimuli interesting coupled together with something like infra-thin kind-of situations?

The first thought that I had for translating internet out of the purely dematerialised plane was using voice, or the voice, or the act of recording people talking. If on one side it gives a characteristically shape of one's being (one's physicality you might even say), on the other it remains still very much an ethereal material.

ASMR is a phenomenon apparently born on in the internet, out of youtube videos, as a way to relax and calm down people through a medium (internet and the computer screen) which perform a different (if not opposite) action on the user/viewer: that on excitement and anxiousness.

The screen spits out light on you face and on your retina, keeping you in an state of almost hypnosis. When you go to bed your eyes will be still full of that holy light which comes out from your computer screen (and with computer I mean also smartphone, or phones).

So it's quite interesting the fact that through these videos, people are in a way trying to produce the opposite effect of what, naturally (lol the word nature), a screen produces on a person' eyes and the internet on a person' mind. It's a site of research about the physical effect which the two vectors produces on one's body.

At the same time, relating more closely to the idea of the General Intellect, of the internet worker, the digital worker, of someone working in front of a screen, these artefacts sparkle a light of interest in the direction of self-care, attention to one's physical and mental health. Paradoxically, or actually not—very much contained in the way of thinking and acting of someone who makes use of the internet nowadays (? what am I saying?)—finding relieve from screen's fatigue happens through the act of searching for something on the internet (or stumbling upon it by *accident* on the internet, in one your of your streams).
