# peer2peer production, watching a film while it’s downloading itself

Last Spring a visiting tutor suggested me to visually record the moment when a film is downloading its data, thanks to other people sharing the file on a torrent server, and transform that moment of data-acquisition into the film itself (instead of the film once it has been completely downloaded).

Last night I thought that a viable option to make this happen would be to screen recording the video file from the very beginning it has been created on my hdd:
* download a torrent file of a film
* open it up with ha video application (is that possible)
* keep it open and start a screen (and audio) recording with QuickTime Player

(*gonna try now*)

It’s not possible to open a .part file of the torrent file you are downloading. To me it seems very strange. How do you read incomplete data?

I opened a .part file with Sublime Text 3, which is the text-editor I use to write code, and it translated that partial file in a series of 4 digit numbers. After a couple of lines it starts to just `0000` instead of `5249` or `4646`.
