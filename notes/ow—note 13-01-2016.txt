# On peer2peer production and the passage from being a worker to be a user

Is labour still a legitimising asset to be able to call someone a political subject? Users are political subjects as well, but is it because they work without often being aware of it? Or are they political subjects because they make use of a software, a service, a product etc.?

Should I move to analyse usership in terms of its political potential? And usership and its relationship to labour and value production?

I want to focus on usership in regard to maintenance workers:
* Amazon M turkers
* wikipediaâ€™s contributors
* ... ?

Are maintenance workers users who make our multiple internet streams valuable and interesting? Such as people we are friend with on facebook and users we follow on twitter?

Or are these definitions already a level higher from the bottom-ground level of an infrastructure running on the internet?
