# Immaterial Labour Isn’t Working

## Open Access Publishing

* There is not such thing as the online market, but just the internet, which gather everything under its arms
* The internet can reproduce anything for free
* price is equals to the marginal cost=on the internet the marginal cost remain the same (1 book or 100 books? on the internet it’s the same, since it’s a digital file, not an extra pack of paper to buy and print)
* what about the maintenance cost? Keeping servers running smoothly? The cost of distribution (the bandwidth?)
* copyright doesn’t work very well on the internet and or digital things (it’s an old fable, forget about it)
* you are selling the production value, not the content itself? (cfr. Comic Books)
* a lot of people don’t do things on the internet thinking about making money out of it

* Open Access Policy in being and Academic
* Open Access=unrestricted peer-review to academic materials
* Green Open Access=free access to what you published
* Gold Open Access=immediate access to the publication (the author has to pay a fee to get that access) (with this you earn more prestige inside the academia field)
* This labour is not paid, just doing it for free
* Obsession of metric-culture, count and measure where you publish and how much reaction that has provoked, etc.
