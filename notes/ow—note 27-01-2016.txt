# Notes for midterm presentation

Transformation from worker to user:

* what does it mean to be an internet user nowadays? What does it imply in relation to labour? (cfr. Inventing the Future and Universal Basic Income, a future where working for a living is no longer necessary)
* analyse this process through the lens of alienation: a constant element not to get rid of, but rather to embody and make use of (cfr. Xenofeminist Manifesto, alienation in order to build freedom and subjectivity)
* internet user as the new political subject, internet as the new political super-infrastructure (cfr. the concept of the stack, Benjamin H. Bratton)
