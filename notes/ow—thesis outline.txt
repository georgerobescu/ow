1. Why what you’re talking about is necessary, interesting, and relevant?
2. What is the purpose of it? What do you hope your research questions will contribute to, change, effect- who is your ideal audience? Is this different than for your creative thesis work? How does it relate to existing conversations of these same discourses, concepts, theories, objects (again what does your work DO to these convos, what is it complicating? What is its significance?)
3. What is your methodology? (how are you achieving your aims, this is important link with your drawing app here?)

## Introduction

This research project is focused on the undergoing transformation of the user, coming from the position of the post-fordist worker. The passage from worker to user means an expansion in the range of people involved in this transformation, and a relative inclusion of many other domains once not part of this dynamics (for example social network platforms).

I think that the topic of the user, in particular understood through the theories present in The Stack by Benjamin Bratton—for which a user is anything (human, animal, vegetal, mineral, robotic, algorithmic, etc.) able to interface with another user—together with the theme of labour, is quite relevant for at least two reasons:
1. it touches upon the formation of our subjectivity in the world, stretching to a wider understanding our relationships with all the other agents surrounding us
2. it makes use of labour as the main driving force through which looking for, and redefining, a different society

I started my research with two assumptions:
* the production of data and metadata by users while using many parts of the web (at least the “safe”, commercial, web—cfr. darknet), often in a state of total or partial non-awareness of processes of data extraction from the companies providing those services
* work as a basic and foundational value of many democratic constitutions (for example, Italy)

From there I moved on to locate in the internet user the current site of social transformations, most crucial for both the sphere of the personal and the one of the political.

Since the extremely precarious and stagnating economic and social situation present in the world in regard to the sphere of work; and in parallel, since the arising of new experiments such as the Universal Basic Income, as a way not to replace the welfare state, but rather to work hand in hand with it; I think that analysing and understanding the labour that we are producing as human-based user on the internet, is essential for thinking of new scenarios for the now and the future and understanding where we might move toward.

The aim of this project is to bring more awareness

Methodologies

## Research questions

* What is the agency of the user in The Stack[^1] of a post-work society?
* How do we reconfigure, as human users, our understanding of labour within a post-work society (cfr. robotic automatisation, users as a variety of subjects—human, non-human, ahuman, etc.—, hence decentering of work as the main formative value of one’s life)?
* Or, how do we build a new post-human ethics for the user of a post-work society?

[^1]: The Stack is “[the accidental megastructure](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/the-black-stack/)” which governs everything (computable) in the world. It is formed by six layers, from top to bottom: 1. user, 2. interface, 3. address, 4. city. 5. cloud, 6. earth.

## Table of Contents w/ chapters summaries

1. **User’s agency**
    * The Stack and the User
    * From God to Work
    * Hubris
2. **Building usership through alienation**
    * Alienation and Post-Humanism
    * What are a user
3. **Post-work society**
    * Universal Basic Income
    * Intellectual Property
4. **Platform’s politics**
    * github’s terms and conditions
    * git’s decentralised structure and github’s centralised one

**1—User’s agency**:  
Contextualisation of the user subject within the structure of The Stack; analysis of the passage from God to labour as the central element to build one’s subjectivity (see Federico Campagna’s The Last Night, where he draws this transformation for which people began to be religious for their job as if it was their new god, after God’s death); exploration of *hubris* within *agency* (hubris from human agents, agency from human, non and ahuman ones), in regard to a post-humanist conception of subject.

**2—Building usership through alienation**:  
Using alienation to stretch the current set of ethics between human-based users and other kind of users, in order to expand them and making a new set of more comprehensive post-human ethics for the user (be it human, animal, vegetal, mineral, machinic, algorithmic, etc).

**3—Post-work society**:
Since the centrality of work as the main vector to form one’s subjectivity in the world (after the death of God), how would a user’s subjectivity be formed in a post-work society? Rather than minimising labour, which is a constituent part of the experience of being a user, labour might be reformulated and understood in a different way: not something to do in order to stay alive, but an activity amongst others accomplished out of personal interest. The Universal Basic Income (UBI), an essential element of a post-work society, further problematises the situation, since we should define who can have access to it: e.g., [what about robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShmbzDceuYo&feature=youtu.be&t=1h25m55s)? Post-humanism is all about co-habiting with subjects of different natures, instead of making them subservients as it is now.

What’s the relevance of Intellectual Property when 1. with a UBI there’s less pressure to make money out of one’s own labour and 2. should, for example, robots and minerals start to put a copyrights for the actions that they enact within the position of users? Furthermore, the idea of originality in a digital environment where the copy is the natural state of files, seems even more out of place.

**Platform’s politics**:
Using [github.com](https://github.com/) as example of the Cloud level of The Stack. Analysis of its political structure and modus operandi. Focus on the passage from git’s[^2] decentralise structure to github.com’s centralised one.

I chose github as an example of platform, because it directly relates to both personal, free-time, labour (evening and weekend projects) and also to job-based, official work. Moreover, in git there is the concept of self-tracking one’s actions as a way to mark, build and save one’s project history (in the case you have to go back to a previous version of your work, or when someone else working with you wants to know what happened when you were working on it). These are two critical points that help to bring everyday mundane aspects of a user’s life closer to the topic of labour itself (github serves as a hub for sharing projects users are working on, mainly for the internet).

[^2]: git is the tool, invented by the founder of Linux, to keep track of software changes during its development. At its core is built around a decentralised architecture, for which each developer can duplicate a copy of the shared project on which the whole team is working on, making edits, and submitting those changes to the rest of the team, without touching the “original”, or master, copy of the project (which is none other than the project’s current approved version, built out of the different changes each member of the team has accomplished).

## Project’s update

Something I’d like to discuss with you is if using the example of github as a “body” to discuss the overall thesis. For this, as I showed you briefly last time, it would be really nice if you could read this text I presented last year as my project’s draft proposal—[ow_draft--1](https://github.com/afincato/ow_draft--1).

0. introduction
    * what is work
    * git and github.com
    * on the irrelevance of democracy to understand the “situation” [^1]
1. user
    * from the post-fordist worker to the internet user
    * user’s agency
    * the stack and the user
2. platform’s politics
    * terms and conditions
    * git’s decentralised structure and github’s centralised one


To address:
* universal basic income (put it in the introduction or at the end in a new chapter?)
* intellectual property

[^1]: The “situation” is both the current one but especially a future scenario for the posthuman and the post-anthropocene. If humanity will stop to feel so central to the world, then why using democracy? Which “people” (demos)? Demos, in the best case, will be one part of the overall picture.
