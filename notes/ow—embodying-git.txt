Anyway, when last week I though about it, it was one night right when I lay down on my bed before got asleep, I probably also knew what was the reason behind this exercise, the connection between the non-physical (is it?) and the physical, the software and the hardware? between the software and the softbody?

A list of the basic git commands, taken from [gitref.org](http://gitref.org):

**Getting and Creating Projects**
* `git-init` @yes
* `git-clone`

**Basic Snapshotting**
* `git-add` @yes
* `git-status` @yes
* `git-diff`
* `git-commit` @yes
* `git-reset`
* `git-rm` @yes
* `git-mv`
* `git-stash`

**Branching and Merging**
* `git-branch`
* `git-checkout`
* `git-merge`
* `git-log`
* `git-tag`

**Sharing and Updating Projects**
* `git-fetch`
* `git-pull`
* `git-push`
* `git-remote`

**Inspection and Comparison**
* `git-log`
* `git-diff`

Referring to [ow—note 06-11-2015.txt](ow—note 06-11-2015.txt), some thoughts about ASMR (Autonomous sensory meridian response) and infra-thin.

It is from these two different kind of sensations that I would like to go on and try to think about a series of videos, for now called "Embodying git": 
* how can you translate git's basic command into corporeal actions? 
* how much the meaning of each word (software command) does influence the way you perform that action? 
* in which kind of environment do you accomplish these actions?
* and with which kind of materials?
* do they directly translate into symbolical or didactical objects and action, to easily mimicking the software counterpart or
* is there a way to get away from that and make use of different materials?
* what if it's possible to *hack* (such a horrible empty word it is becoming) into already existing everyday actions (like brushing your teeth?)

Why do I find this extremely sensorial stimuli interesting coupled together with something like infra-thin kind-of situations?

The first thought that I had for translating internet out of the purely dematerialised plane was using voice, or the voice, or the act of recording people talking. If on one side it gives a characteristically shape of one's being (one's physicality you might even say), on the other it remains still very much an ethereal material.

ASMR is a phenomenon apparently born on the internet, out of youtube videos, as a way to relax and calm people down through a medium (internet and the computer screen) which perform a different (if not opposite) action on the user/viewer: that of excitement and anxiousness.

The screen spits out light on you face and on your retina, keeping you in an state of almost hypnosis. When you go to bed your eyes will be still full of that holy light which comes out from your computer screen (and with computer I mean also phones, etc.).

So it's quite interesting the fact that through these videos, people are in a way trying to produce the opposite effect of what, naturally (lol the word nature), a screen produces on a person' eyes and the internet on a person' mind. It's a site of research about the physical effect which the two vectors produces on one's body.

At the same time, relating more closely to the idea of the General Intellect, of the internet worker, the digital worker, of someone working in front of a screen, these artefacts sparkle a light of interest in the direction of self-care, attention to one's physical and mental health. Paradoxically, or actually not—very much contained in the way of thinking and acting of someone who makes use of the internet nowadays (? what am I saying?)—finding relieve from screen's fatigue happens through the act of searching for something on the internet (or stumbling upon it by *accident* on the internet, in one of your streams).

Moving towards the idea of embodying and or translating git’s commands into physical representation imageries of physical activities and desires.

1. *porn & sex* or *porn & desire*  
as git’s commands can easily hint at that context ad especially it can be connected to the infamous github repo [DICSS](https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS)
2. [brogrammer](http://gizmodo.com/5910824/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-brogrammer) culture?
3. [cabinporn](http://cabinporn.com) culture?  
(pretty typical and almost cliché of the “escaping the office for the wild nature” feeling

I feel I can move away from these common imaginaries and let each git’s action (verb) decides where to go.

## Composition

1. Video of one of the selected verbs from git’s basic actions as the center and background of the video.
2. Other smaller and differently framed (different proportions and ratios) videos on top of the “main” one. Porn & sexual desires videos (or other subjects) contextually referring and expanding and building an imagery based on each git’s command.

Thinking of using my iPhone 5 to shoot the videos and using—at least as a first idea for a possible scenario—the studio and my table (laugh). Stuck, or interested, in an aesthetic of office-studio working environment, with plants, light coloured woods and white tables. Not too aseptic, not too warm and *crazy*: something, though emanating a sense of *asceticism* (not austerity).

I am thinking of that thin veil of sadness encompassing Ghost in the Shell main character, [Motoko Kusanagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Kusanagi) (especially in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence)

Since five days I am using [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com), a small app/utility that “makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day”.

Last night I was working late on a client project and I let f.lux doing its job, reason for which at 3 am the screen was getting more and more red but quite pleasant to my eyes.

I want to use also this color game in the videos I am going to do, and especially in the first one I’d like to play with this passage between red and blue, as if the amniotic fluid is cradling me but then slowly I am moving away.

I don’t know if I really want to use the amniotic fluid metaphor but okay. I am thinking more of a stronger, harsher, blockage stamp-like action to mark the `init` part in git.

> He says of the project’s inception, that he was intrigued by an oddly “naive idea of nature that seemed strikingly prevalent in my social environment.. I was curious to know how these simulations of Nature work in digital media, how do we do experience these simulated materials”.
[J.G. Biberkopf](http://www.k-n-i-v-e-s.com) about his album “Ecologies”.

Similarly, my interest with this video (probably “these videos”) lies in the explorative dimension of how much git influences a certain way of working, thinking, acting, moving, and so forth. Hence, which kind of imaginaries does it provoke in one’s mind? Which kind of associations when thinking about `git-init` or `git-commit` or `git-push`?

I just finished to read a paper on obfuscation called “Vernacular resistance to data collection and analysis: A political theory of obfuscation”. I am not sure that’s a direction I want to take research-wise (or maybe not as the primary one), but still aesthetically I find it very interesting, because it reminds me of the exhibition which took place during the month of October at w139. It was called Ch’u, and it was about

> The steam bath (– i.e. fog, mist, haze, interference –) is one component of C'hu: an extension of a shared interest in algorithmic, mechanical and biological processes and the ongoing breakdown of the binary logic of the human and non-human at the heart of the cybernetic body. Did we talk already about the-dog-that-was-wolf?
> The show locates the uncertainty inherent to complex systems in the non-linear structure beyond individual perception and proposes the idea of state of distributed autonomy between server networks, architecture, the psychoactive potential of plants, choreography and fog; to help us "un-think what we don't know we are thinking".
> Self-intoxication as self-surrection, politics of heat maps, a proposal for mess and a "consent to not be a single being".

More over, the general feeling Julika had over my interest in git was mainly about tracking and self-tracking. Which is true but also, as I see it personally, a mere starting point to move towards many other different loci (loci? places?).Yet, the essential point of departure to talk about subjectivity and human-machine-human relationships.

As I was thinking this morning, self-tracking in git is not the same as all the other apps or the general trend about the quantified-self. Or is it? I am not sure self-tracking in git presupposes a better understanding of yourself through your logged actions. It can be extremely helpful as a way to have a more granular overview and control over the project you are working on, but not necessarily bringing as side-effect a better picture of how you work.

Because that’s one of the central question: to which level of self-reflection can a tool like git can be used? Is it just a 2.0 pre-punched card? It is not.

Interestingly enough, or quite shamefully, I almost completely avoided to look into the bros culture and its aesthetics. Similarly, the same happened for internet-based companies space environments. And more importantly, I have zero interest for the mythical figure of the hacker.

At first, what I thought was quite inspiring was a film such as *Tetsuo—The Iron Man*. Though not clear, the main (?) characters looks like a middle class, white-collar dude finding a great interest in developing his own body into something else (than what it is now). Namely, overcoming the neat separation between human flesh and metal(-made) machine. Not completely transforming into a machine but retaining, indeed, some fundamental aspects of the human body or of what it is to be human.

Although I am not planning to work on this kind of transformation (yet?), I am quite drawn by the visual elements of the film because it’s very much rough in different ways: it is shot on black and white film; it has a violent and direct aesthetic regarding the portraying of the bodies and the overall “reality” of the film, it’s very punk—indeed one of the finest? example of Japanese cyberpunk (≠ from American cyberpunk); sexuality is heavily present and especially a particular description of the body (people sweating a lot, people’s way of breathing, people’s facial expression), which is in-between a manga style and a Brechtian kind-of theatre?

Last week I came across a copy of *The Gentlewoman*, and browsing through it I found a short article on how to stretch and stay fit at the office where you work.

The female model, or actress?, was doing (making?) some exercises using the office-printer as a piece of architecture through which extend her arms and back (pushing towards the printer while grabbing it to counter-balance her horizontal extension). In another picture, she is giving her back to the desk and stretching the upper part of her body using the table as an handhold (mostly arching her back out). In another shot she’s facing the desk and inclining her body to 45° using her arms to accomplish it.

These pictures are very telling of different aspects of the “modern” life in the office—should it still be labeled as modern? Or, rather post-fordist?

Still, my initial idea was to explore the possibilities of five-six selected basic commands you can do with git. So, beginning from the word itself, always a verb, moving on and, probably using a grid of some sorts (e.g. the five points present in `ow_draft--1` and used as chapters of the text-manifesto) exploring this verb in regard to git and to (digital) post-fordist labour happening in on and for the internet.

Last night I decided I want to use snippets of J.G. Biberkopf’s latest albume, *Ecologies*.

The videos are not turning into music videos, or picturing *Ecologies*’ track list, rather I want to see if they could be a good layer in the creation of a particular mood for the videos.

What’s the main action performed by a human body? Some hidden folder to keep tracks of other non-hidden (main?) folders are created to build the skeleton of the tracking tool:
* cutting big green leaves with a small knife
* cutting an avocado in two and sucking the pit
* setting up one’s own working table
* diving into water with a rope
* cutting one’s own arm in order to prepare oneself for the transformative process coming soon
* making one’s hair: using a comb, fix them with a hair elastic bracelet
