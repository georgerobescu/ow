# Drawing cursor

The other night I came up with the idea to transform the movement of a cursor on a screen, performed by a/the user, into drawings. Meaning, tracking the cursor’s movements and translate those paths into lines and other graphical forms (e.g., a click would become a circle, instead than a line).

Reporting my initial notes jotted down on paper:

> A piece of software that runs in the background and draws lines based on the cursor’s movements (dragging, scrolling, moving, clicking, etc.) of a user.

> The recording time can be set to be from 1 hour to a full day (=8 hours? 15 hours?).

> Send email to A V and ask him how much this is feasible to accomplish.

> *What to do with this drawings? Why do I want to produce them*?
  
> As a mirror and consideration of the level of passive exploitation of a user’s activity.

> Then: how can this be related to an extended understanding of the user in the Stack’s sense?

Talking with G the whys behind the idea seemed silly. Instead, the action itself to do something like this (an app that tracks and traduces your cursor’s movements into drawings) acquired a performative and bodily value: it means embodying a user’s usage of “one of the most hyper-intimate instrument”.

Said this, as a quick and dirty test, I want to implement this as a Chrome extension. There’s already plugin that lets you draw on a webpage, using the `<canvas>` object as a... canvas.

The order of actions I am giving myself now, to execute the project, is as follows:

1. Building a webpage were moving the cursor automatically initiates a drawing session on the page, without having to click on a button or anything to start drawing.
2. Transforming the above ↑ in a Chrome extension, were clicking on the extension’s icon initiates the tracking of the cursor, hence a drawing session; and clicking again on it will stop the session.
3. Transforming the above ↑ in an app/utility to install on your computer, and in this way being able to always track your cursor’s movement, no matter the context (e.g., only in the browser).

At the end of each drawing session you’ll have the chance to export your drawing session in a `.png` file.
