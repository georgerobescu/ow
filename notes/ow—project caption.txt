Project description (max. 100 words):
*ow* explores the status of work on the internet: overturning the activity of tracking from an invisible process performed upon internet users, to an action each of them do on purpose, how do users work together? What’s the role of agency in this? When does working stop? The recent rising, in the public debate, of post-work societies, where work is mostly automatised by machines, goes in parallel with the discourse of a posthuman turn as well: if we consider users entities ranging from human, to machinic, mineral, animal, plant, bot, etc—how do they relate to each other?

*ow* explores the status of work on the internet:
How does work play a central role for human beings? Moving from a scenario of a possible post-work society, where work is, for the most part, automatised by machines, to the context of work on the internet, what is a user? How can the activity of tracking be overturned without changing its effects?

*ow* explores the status of work on the internet:
in spite of a possible post-work society, where work is mostly automatised by machines, how does this central human activity take place on the internet?
What is a user, and how does it relate with other users?

*ow* explores the status of work on the internet:
moving between scenarios of post-work societies to an understanding of what a user is in relation to labour, the project asks questions such as 1. what is the driving force toward performing work? 2. how do users relate to each other? 3. how does agency modulate within a user position?
