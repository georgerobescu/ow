Project description (max. 100 words):
*ow* explores the status of work on the internet: overturning the activity of tracking from an invisible process performed upon internet users, to an action each of them do on purpose, how do users work together? what’s the role of agency? when does working stop? The recent rising, in the public debate, of post-work societies, where work is mostly automatised by machines, goes in parallel with the discourse on a posthuman turn as well: if we consider users entities ranging from human, to machinic, mineral, animal, plant, bot, etc—how do they relate to each other?
