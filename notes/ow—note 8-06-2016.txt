# Comments on the thesis from tutor

* be less implicit, not walk around things, just try to express them
* too much focus on the functioning of github
* explain more the political implications of the platform and of the users

* work more out the last part with the political developments of the platform and put your thoughts in it
* if you expand it, you can publish it
