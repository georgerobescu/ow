## From the post-fordist worker to the internet user

There is a common desire, between freelancers, to escape the position of employee, and so a position of “willing slave of Capital” [^1], with the counter-effect, instead, of having turned their whole life to work, completely.

[^1]: From Frédéric Lordon’s book *Willing Slaves of Capital*: a willing slave of capital is (...)

When at the beginning of the 70s, the new figure of the post-fordist worker began to arise, there seemed to be so many possibilities for autonomy and liberation from work: I can be empowered by flexible working hours, so deciding my own schedule; I can set my own hourly price-rate; I can work for six months and save some money, then spend the next six months fulfilling my own desires (travelling, side projects, hobbies, etc.).

For the most part, this empowerment flipped from being from the side of the self-employed worker to the one of the boss. Flexibility became «you can set your own schedule, but we can call you anytime, any day». 

Precarity began to spread as the virus and byproduct of neoliberal and managerial politics, which fully understood the potentiality for subtle power-relations, while still leaving the impression to workers of giving them more freedom than it used to be only a decade before.

Paradoxically, now in the Netherlands and in other European countries, whenever you apply for a job, often times you are hired as a freelancer: they, the companies, don’t have to pay taxes for your work, they can conclude the contract anytime they want (with a minimum of warning), they can set a variable price-rate, while still keeping all the positive sides from hiring a freelancer: maximum flexibility and good-quality of the job produced, usually. Freelancers become, then, total “willing slaves of capital” as well.

This is not the only scenario possible—people are able to live off of it and build a good life—but still, in all cases, flexibility from the side of the self-employed worker is always required and has become the de-facto concession you have to give, as a freelancer, to the company or boss hiring you for a job: your position comes with many privileges—e.g. working from home or a cafe all day—so there has to be something *more* you can give back, or give up—depending on how you see it.

All the people performing affective and emotional labour are often kept away from the set of bodies composing the post-fordist worker subject. From care worker spending their days, for e.g., with elderly and disabled people, to precariats working at call-centers, to waitresses and shopkeepers, the affective aspect of the labour performed may vary in the percentage demanded, but it has become a prerequisite for all the jobs in the service economy. At first reclaimed by feminists during the 70s (in parallel with the formation of the post-fordist worker) as the essential labour housewives performed from centuries without any recognition, but simply seen as a form of women’s natural predisposition in becoming mothers and partners; now emotional labour is still not fully recognised as a task contributing to a good execution of a job, hence deserving monetary compensation, but always asked as part of one’s skills set, under the title of *soft skills*.

Post-fordism can be divided into a) intellectual, or mental; and b) affective and emotional labour. The most cited examples to represent the position are the ones of the journalist, the academic, the designer, and so forth. But it is important to recall all the area of care work performed and, as said, often not taking part in the definition of post-fordism. Because most post-fordist jobs are in their definition, precarious, temporary, seasonal, on a for-project basis, etc. And if that on one side, might have (maybe) helped the market for a part-time job for students and newly became mothers who before having babies had a full time job, it then drifted to perversely making people having to find three or four part-time jobs for mere life sustaining. The empowerment of flexibility flipped side once again and became a nightmare.

The internet user becomes the last iteration of a process began with the formation of the post-fordist worker. Before that, most people were working in factories or in office jobs, and the division of space-time where, for the most part, very much defined. The sentence, or tagline, or aphorism, that goes “work is play and play is work” wasn’t really part of the popular culture, as it might be today. 

Internet overcame that space-time division even more than the development of post-fordism could have ever done, in that you can really work from anywhere with a computer terminal and an internet connection. But if that was the case already during the late 80s and mid 90s, where there was still a clear act of performing labour, in the sense of working and being aware of doing that, we are now embedded in a moment where capital comes to look for you: you sending a message over facebook to your friend? That’s good metadata to sell to some ad-company; you buying a flight ticket to London using google? Then google can suggest you also these other products.

This ontological shift in the definition of the internet user is essential in understanding how labour has transformed on one side, and also to re-understand what a subject is nowadays.

With user, indeed, I refer to “anything producing data and able to interface with another entity producing data as well” (The Stack, Benjamin Bratton). This already brings up a conception of subject more extended than only the human subject, and for this not less able to perform the most various set of tasks you can imagine.

So the internet user is a moving away from the anthropocentric conception of worker, being it in the fordist manner as it is in a factory, or in the post-fordist one when suddenly he she was able to organise his her life and also the job(s) to sustain such life. With internet user, I defin

> The open entanglements of multiple apparatuses express different postures and positions, some of which can innovate cultural norms and invent new Users on the scene.
> More often, however, at the global scale of The Stack, the User position is reserved for a reductive regularization into customized utilitarianism, and when that is mobilized for planetary-scale interfacial regimes, then its identification with the local reflections of computational mirrors can make it alien even to its own experiences. (...) and in the revelation of the robust subjectivity of other nonhuman but computationally complex Users.

> The more salient design problem seems less to design for Users, as if they were stable forms to be known and served, than to design and redesign the User itself in the image of whatever program might enroll it.

> (...) “death of the user.” By this, I mean the expiration of a specific kind of user, and the displacement its soft humanism from the conceptual center of design strategy by the proliferation and predominance of both nonhuman and nonindividuated actors within the expanded field of ubiquitous computation.

> The baseline design brief for the User layer of The Stack may go something like this: In the image of planetary-scale information infrastructure, comprising trillions of addressable haecceities, the resolved scale of the platform need not be for one User at a time, drifting into and out of narcissistic virtual reality, but for pluralities of partial users, quasi-users, human and nonhuman, organic and inorganic, intermingling in intersubjective alliances, sharing perceptions, memory, algorithms and techniques, visualization rhetorics situated among the semantic graphs of aggregate User experiences predicated not just on autobiographical interoperability, but on direct physical and cognitive promiscuity. Imagine one sort of User logging the totality of her perceptions and interactions not as an atomic iota lost in her own manifestations (like Bell’s MyLifeBits QS persona) but as a population of 10 billion absolute Users, all generating content and all feeding off one another’s issuances. Plural systems provide plural images, which provide plural Users—two of us, ten of us, a hundred of us, an entire city of us—literally seeing through each other’s eyes, remembering through one another’s experiences, walking in one another’s shadows. Imagine Jakob von Uexküll’s foray through the garden of Umwelten, where he encountered the interweaving but exclusive lifeworlds of plants, animals, flowers, and insects, but in our biosemiotic field, everything can now swap points of view. Tomorrow, may I have your yesterday? Unexpected alliances, continental organizations, linguistic traditions, and politico-theological communions ensue, any one User moving into and out of several of them, just as they move into and out of him. The profile reflected back is not of a resolved individual but of empathetic assemblages across multiple spatial and rhythmic scales. Furthermore, as nonhuman users (sensors, animals, artificial intelligence, what-have-you) are enrolled into these collaborative perceptual-interfacial affiliations and plat- forms, the contingent hierarchies between physical subjects and objects are put once again into play. So instead of the Shanghai Expo’s universal User scenario, where the cosmopolitan apparatus of The Stack would interpolate each human as an interoperable atomic profile, however comparable and equalized they might appear, *can it instead come to provide and even demand far more alien subjectification en masse*? These would perhaps be unaccountable, even invisible to, the dynamics of individuation versus collectivization, physicalization versus virtualization, localization versus globalization—neither solution nor dissolution, only strange columns up and down The Stack, and from strange columns new geographies and geopolitics for a post-Anthropocenic User.

> To the extent that the composition of the User as a biopolitical subject also includes vectors of data—genomic, microbial, microeconomic, metaecological—into the living diagram of interpolation, then the site of the subject is experienced as fully infused and overcome with extrinsic flows such that the coherence, stability, and confidence previously invested in the visual fade away.

> putting nonhumans into that User position should be seen as a temporary station at best, but perhaps a means to invent different kinds of agencies, not just mimicking this degraded human. We must save the nonhumans from being merely humans, so that they could show us a different way for us to be both human and not.
> In its place we imagine a re-wilded landscape of inhumanist intentions, mapped by multipolar points of control, composing a more polysynchronic and less chauvinistic system of systems.

> Something else needs to sideline the vestigial, embarrassing anthropocentrism that brings the false flattery of passive (or passive-aggressive) assistants. In fact, the stage management of the human User as somehow commanding the work of the App is already, we may conclude, an unnecessary alibi protecting the essential opposite effect (that the mammal User is only a provisional mechanism for dragging gigaflop tracking devices through the avenues of cities and for remonetizing these routes as the spatial career of algorithmic capital and its successors).

> the longer-term geopolitical design problem is the design of the User itself—its limits, vulnerabilities, velocities.

> Counterintuitive as it may seem, the design decision should not be to locate sovereignty in the encapsulated person who steps into the User position but instead into the position itself.
> From The Stack’s perspective, the User is (...) defined by what it connects to, not by who or what it “is.”

## From the post-fordist worker to the internet user

There still is a strong desire amongst freelance workers able to spur them to take a solo, independent career and, in doing so, avoiding to be under a boss.

Only for then being under a variety of bosses, being that a company, a client, they themselves even, and so forth.

Post-fordism arose in the early 1970s as a transformation of the current production model of the time, the fordist-method applied to the factory and, fresh of the free liberation of desires coming from the 1968, together with the application, for the first time, of neoliberal politics, repositioned in the figures of information producers and workers a new faith for the extraction of surplus value.

Common examples of these new job positions are the ones of the journalist, the academic researcher, the designer, etc.

But since the production and usage of informations means indeed the production of language, also figures like the one of the call-center worker are part of this new area. And more over, it is important to remember also all the care work area, meaning affective and emotional labour performed mainly by women in different context: waitresses and shopkeepers, care workers, nurses, masseuses, prostitutes and so on.

Affective and emotional labour are not exclusive of these jobs—they are present, in different quantities, in many other form of labour—but for sure they are the most visible and often forgotten type of employments, when talking about post-fordism.

A common element that many, if not all, of these jobs have in common is giving value to flexibility. When during the late 60s and early 70s flexibility was requested by students-finding-a-job and workers, as part of the transformations taking place in the work field, it was seen by these subjects as a positive and important achievement. They could finally manage, on their on terms, their life and work, they could set their own working schedule, they could decide to have a short-term contract and spend three months at a job, three months in another job, then other five months, for example, travelling (or fulfilling personal aspirations). Ironically, this same lust for flexibility was also happily accepted by the employers. And the capital shifted in the capturing of the workforce from the traditional one in the form of brutal, physical energy, sealed in each and every worker; to the working-desire, the desire for work they all had. The desire for self-realisation and, together with this, the energies produced through intellectual/mental labour and the one from emotional and affective labour. This passage marked a transition from the employers mainly demanding physical energy, to demand mental and affective energy on top of the physical one.

Workers were happy not to have fixed jobs. This meant going against a long tradition imposed by their family, for which you had to look out for the job of life—which was essential to build a family, a shared life, and reaching a form of stability. Instead, post-fordism introduced words such as part-time job, flexible hours, and in so doing also the idea of precarity.

For many job positions, such as, for e.g., the one of the journalist, the academic, the designer, etc. these new elements could have been taken in such a way that, after some years of paying one’s dues, they may have reached a better position at the office they were working at, or maybe even setting up their own practice. But what would have changed after five years of working at a call-center? Or as a care-worker for and with elderly and disabled people?

From the beginning of this new economy—which for the most part developed in the western world, but now can be seen outsourced to countries of the south-east Asia such as India (cfr. click-farms)—the popularisation of computers and databases were, for sure, essential elements in defining a new working environment, slowly then becoming part of society at large. 

When in 1996, Maurizio Lazzarato wrote a text on Immaterial Labour, that umbrella term was quite useful to try to define and bring to light a new iteration of what post-fordism became after twenty-five years of development.

> The consumer is no longer limited to consuming commodities (destroying them in the act of consumption). On the contrary, his or her consumption should be productive in accordance to the necessary conditions and the new products. Consumption is then first of all a consumption of information. Consumption is no longer only the "manufacturing" of a product, but a real and proper social process that for the moment is defined with the term communication.

Nowadays, that description has become obslete, because it is so embedded in the dominant societal order in which we live, that nobody is out of its reach. It is no more a specialised subset of professions for the most part contributing to this economic processes, but whoever being in some form, part of society. 

If in moving to the post-fordist worker subject, Capital began to be interested in accumulating desires—in the form of information production of some kind—while getting a bit more closer and intimate with the subjective sphere of a worker (mental labour, emotional labour, and so on); now with the internet user it is a matter of simply “living” and doing the things you do in your everyday life: the Capital needs only that to extract surplus value from your activities.

It is this the connection between post-fordist worker and internet user: data is now relevant for the Capital, not only when produced at work and for some very specific purposes, but as data itself, no matter the kind of environment in which it is born. Some value is produced out of it anyway. The precarious position often embedded within the post-fordist subject, even in the position of unemployment, now makes sense. Everybody at home can be capitalised by only browsing the internet. And home has become your phone and computer, rather than a physical fixed site. Labour has been dematerialised (?) both in terms of time, space, and also action.

## User’s agency

(re-understanding conatus as labour in relation to computation)

Data is essential to re-understand the user subject. This position implies an expansion of the entities capable of taking part in this role, opening it up to animal, mineral, plant, machinic, bot and algorithmic user, besides the human one. Data becomes the common ground that enables human-user to interface with non-human and in-human ones.

For this reason, there must be a shift at the ontological level in the language we use to talk about it: organism can’t include all the different natures of which the user may be composed of. What does inhuman and ahuman imply, then? Not a desire to define these other natures against the human’s one, through a process of negation with which producing a definition of each entity. Rather, it mostly helps to remind us that the human user is only one possible variant within the user position, stressing a movement of expansion that finds superfluous the connotation organic/inorganic, and instead sites in the terms ‘operative, operational’ and ‘interoperability’ a new kind of language.

It is essential to understand how this shift, from an understanding of user as a living being to one in which its way of being in the world is through producing data (*being operative*), traces a line to the concept of conatus.

If conatus is «the effort by which ‘each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being» [^1], then is this still applicable to any form of user, beyond living organisms?

[^1]: Frédéric Lordon quoting Benedictus de Spinoza, Ethics, part III, in “Willing Slaves of Capital”.

What do we mean by «strives to persevere in its being» in connection to a user? Does a user strive to keep producing data and interfacing with other users, in order to avoid falling in dead, non-operative moments? Is there such a thought from the perspective of a user? Or maybe it’s not really a matter of having dead periods of time since we can compare the status of being operative as the one of being alive and breathing?

In a sense, then, the question might not be how much of an effort users have to do in order to keep striving to persevere in their beings, but rather how much they are aware of the streams of data production and interaction they are part of and, even maybe, how much they do want to acknowledge this as “effort”.

For, if with the original, spinozian definition of conatus, there is an idea of effort, comparable to an act of labour to keep staying alive; in the context of the user, labour is not always a conscious performative act, but an ever-happening activity, no matter the effort one’s put in it: it then can be channelled for a specific outcome when the outputted data is used for this or that other reasons, tasks, aim, etc.

Being operative, in this frame, means then not being alive, or being on/off. Instead, it’s a matter of how to interface with other users and produce a different output with the convergence of two, or more, fluxes of data.

In the context of a post-work society where human users will live with a Universal Basic Income, will the idea of conatus disappear even more? Or will it change in the way it frames its significance since, with the rising and acknowledgment of many other users, human beings will have to strive to keep being relevant in their inter-operativeness amongst other peers [^2]?

[^2]: From Benjamin Bratton’s [The Black Stack](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/the-black-stack/):  
> Worse than being seen as an enemy is not being seen at all. As Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it, “The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”

Looking at it in this way then, for human users conatus will not be a matter of striving for one’s sustaining, but striving for finding new ways to interface with all the rest of users, in forms which destabilise humanist understanding of *being* in the world, language and accountability, and so forth.

Conatus becomes a new form of labour, addressing a personal strive to stay together with others, and so, in how to use one’s data production to re-position oneself in the world.

(user’s agency)

How does user’s agency manifest itself, then?

Unlike one might assume, an entity (algorithmic, mineral, human, etc.) does not correspond to a user in a 1:1 ratio: a subject takes place in the user position fulfilling a set of actions, but in doing this, it is being transformed because of that position.

To give an example: when we send an email, the user is composed by a part of us (the one thinking and writing the text, choosing a recipient, etc.) [^3], but also by the email client and the service provider.

[^3]: But then, language is not spoken by us, we are spoken by it (add reference?). So even in this action of language production the human user is a composite user formed by a human agent and language.

For these reasons, user’s agency doesn’t correspond to only one entity’s desires, but it is shaped by many different agents, forming an array of desires and positions often visible in ways we at first don’t recognise.

For example: in recent years the tracking activities employed by many web services have become part of public opinion’s general topics of discussion. Keeping the same logic described above, it is easier to see how often the intentions we have and want to put into actions, say sending a message in which we talk about particular things, are being captured, read, processed and spitted back to us in the form of tailored ads, tracing a direct relation between the topics in our conversations and the products suggested to us.

Agency is then, like the user position, computational. Data is the common language that permits everyone taking place in the user position, to find interfaces, hence languages, through which to talk and read and listen to other agents—for example, part of a platform.

It is clear how, more often than not, we are part of composite users. But instead of thinking of “other users” as “other human beings”, we need to apply the word user to a more vast variety of entities that, for e.g., we normally consider tools. Computation makes this easier to understand, because it transforms everything into data-format. Conversely computation, in the process of destroying humanist values and anthropocentric orders of the world, makes no exception or favour to anyone.

There is a need for a new literacy of computation, after the failed project of cybernetics. Instead of looking for an original cosmological order, or silently praying for chaos, we have the chance to step out and aside of the current human language we have in use, to get closer to a variety of users in ways different than before.

Interfaces are the place where disputing how user’s agency is being read and performed. Also for this, they become integral in the redefinition of what is life, what is labour, and the transformation of these two spheres into the one of operations, operational and being operative.

`git` and github.com can be an experiment for a new literacy of computation.

* * *

(building status and building history)

Whereas oral language tends toward the creation of missing links  (black holes) in the recalling of a fact we used to know, and it takes over someone’s memory, computational language—even better than written human language—has a tendency to track everything. It keeps traces of what it has been processed and put them in indexes. Sure, it’s possible to edit those traces, and in so doing producing corrupted links between data sets, but that’s not the point. 

At a structural level, computational language transforms the substantive ‘archive’ into a verb. As a consequence, that’s what we began to do as well, as human users.

`git` works in the same manner, with the difference that the user has to comment after one, or a bunch of, edits performed, about what happened in doing those changes.

This action is called `git-commit`, and it helps to log more clearly what was changed throughout the history of a project.

This mechanism of tracking and commenting, tracking and commenting, forces the user to start adopting a particular mindset—or at least confronting him herself with a thinking mode very well defined (and maybe at odds with his her own).

`git-commit` was conceived as a useful option when working on distributed software project (e.g. Linux), because for each new improvement or feature added to the codebase, all the rest of the team could easily see what was changed and proposed, then deciding if approving it or not.

If on its original form it works as a way to make someone responsible for his her actions, especially when in relation to a common project, the same `git-commit` can be used to add messages with no real connection to the work executed, and building a different, parallel history of the project.

In working with git either on your own or within a team, this second approach toward building a project’s history makes no sense. Injecting a disconnected and ‘other’ narrative to describe a very precise but different set of decisions produces confusion and anger, in the case a future user will read the repository’s history. At the same time it’s a useful thinking to foster unwanted or non-conceived usages (using the commit text to talk with the rest of the team, so generating a forth and back of changes also in order to keep going with the conversations; doubling one’s activity between coding a website and writing a narrative about it while developing the project; etc.).

What is important to remember, is that this is as well a mechanism to build one’s accountability within a project. Though on github.com users don’t receive marks of any kind (points, or stars, or karma, and so forth), they are very much responsible in the developing of a project. Since every commit is viewable by anyone (except for when a repository is private, but that’s almost never the case), anyone accessing the url of a github repository can see what happened and when. Who did what and which reason was given to accomplish that.

In a sense then, the process of developing a project, double binds with both the process of building a history of that project, and at the same time of building a level of accountability for each contributor who takes part in it.

As an uncommon choice for a social platform’s architecture, on github.com first and foremost comes the project repositories, then the users working on them. With this shift in the order and visibility of a user, it is clear to see why his or her accountability is directly attached to specific projects. I commit therefore I am operative.
