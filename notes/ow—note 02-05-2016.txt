# Notes for a new literacy of computation

Using the reformulated concept of conatus, understood as a continuous strive to interface (find the interface to interface) with another user (users of different natures) in connection with `git` as a way to track (compute?) the experience of it.

`git`’s project repositories are computed facts (or attempts to be facts), interfaces are survival mechanisms to cope with being operative as users.

This is part of *git-embodying—embodying-git*.

*Posthuman user and labour*

* post-work society: human’s struggle to provide him herself a basic sustaining is over
* conatus moves away from being associated with activities to sustain one’s life, obtained through work, but turns into a continual attempt–research to find the better interface with which interacting with users of different nature
* the common language-material to build these interfaces is (user-produced) data and computation
* to shift from post-fordist workers to internet users, git and github.com are used, in order to track the basic conatus of interfaces-finding while interacting with other users
* git then, becomes a way to assess one’s being in the world, not because of a living entity, but because of his-her-its being operative.

on work:
* post-fordist worker → internet user
* conatus as constant struggle to preserving one’s usership (as in, the user’s ontological feature of being operative)
* towards a post-work and posthuman society
* labour shifts from a way to sustain one’s life, to retain one’s operativeness (a user’s capacity to interface with another user and exchange data)
* git as a form (or a help) to track this operativeness (interfacing data)
* git helps in figuring out new interfaces on-the-go and preserving these experiences (and or facts)
