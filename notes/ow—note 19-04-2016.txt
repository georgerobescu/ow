# On ending the introduction chapter of the thesis

## Democracy as desert, freedom from work

Carmelo Bene on democracy:

> What's the only form of government which guarantees something? Democracy, no doubts. Paradoxically it's the most acceptable. Emil Cioran made a good analysis about it.

> So I ask you: what does democracy guarantee that a dictatorship does not? Sure! It guarantees something—do you know what is it? **It guarantees life to be unlivable**. It doesn't figure out your life! Who chooses democracy, who chooses freedom, chooses the desert—if democracy were freedom at all. But democracy is nothing, democracy is pure demagogy.

A framing of democracy as the one quoted above—though quite hypothetical in its declaration [^1]—positions one’s life to a very radical question: what does frame and shape your life?

[^1]: For only to the fact that democracy might never really have happened.

What would happen then, if work would lose its centrality in the society we live in and shifted to a different grade of importance in the making of one’s life?

It is this understanding of democracy that connects well with the postulation of a post-work society: as Carmelo Bene said, freedom would be, first of all, liberation from work.

Though work would never go away from human’s activities, a reframing of its cultural importance is necessary to move away from the contemporary ubiquity it has today. 

The most crucial challenge is not to get rid of work in itself, understood either as a job or as any activity performed in order to sustain one’s life and make a living. Rather, it is shifting work to any activity demanding a certain amount of energy, attention, and interest no matter the context.

The democratic aspect in this process of transformation, lies in the fact that work is set free from a basic desire of subsistence, of conatus as work.

This is not to prevent the production of other form of values and rather, it is a way to foster many other “excessive energies” [^2] from the activities one can perform instead of dead wage-labour.

[^2]: With “excessive energies” I refer to Georges Bataille’s ideas expressed in The Accursed Share.

## 2. socialism? and value production and distribution

Though I don’t really know about how to make use of socialism, both because I don’t really know much about it and also as a way to manage value production and redistribution, I still quickly want to see if it might be a better, more interesting and potentially viable way to accomplish such task, instead of relying to democracy.

If socialism happens when each of us own the means of production, making tabula rasa then of capitalists and capitalism as a set of hegemonic ideas and values, then could socialism be applied to the current organisational structure of github.com?

First quick reply: as a github user, you own the data you upload over their servers, but since they provide the infrastructure, you are in their hands, whether there’s any problem on the servers, the software running github.com, etc.

`git` is a free and open source software project, so it’s yours to be used. The git logo and term “git” is not anyway, in order to «[avoid confusion](https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source)».

This brings to the questions of using a decentralised-by-design system in a centralised website.

At the same time, there’s a factor for which, still keep using github.com is useful (since you should anyway have local copies of your repositories in the case the service would fail or change too much for your own taste to still own your data), and it mostly has to do with the problem of living in a current situation enmeshed within a particular dominant society:
* even if you spend all the time you have to set up your private, decentralised servers for emails, git, and any other thing you might need both for personal and professional use, how do you deal when you have to work with other people in a company using one of the dominant, non-free software, service available? Same when you have to show your work in order, for example, to get a job;
* it takes time to learn and maintain those technologies you want to set up by yourself in order to not be dependant on centralised option


> And this example is one of many that shows why we free software people are not the many but the few: because we need help from large organizations, given that we’re WORKERS and not some kind of ideal entity with all the time of the world and all the resources. We need our little free time after work for ourselves, and we also need our identity when facing society to be a legit one and not a pariah/freak one. And that’s a big deal. We need the FSF, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and so on, because it’s not that simple as installing GNU on our devices and setting up our own server instances of whatever.

What’s the weight of new literacy about technologies, tied together with new “progressive infrastructures” that adopt non-centralised cultural and technical systems?
