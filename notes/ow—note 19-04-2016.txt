Carmelo Bene on democracy:

> What's the only form of government which guarantees something? Democracy, no doubts. Paradoxically it's the most acceptable. Emil Cioran made a good analysis about it.

> So I ask you: what does democracy guarantee that a dictatorship does not? Sure! It guarantees something—do you know what is it? It guarantees life to be unlivable. It doesn't figure out your life! Who chooses democracy, who chooses freedom, chooses the desert—if democracy were freedom at all. But democracy is nothing, democracy is pure demagogy.

A framing of democracy as the one quoted above—though very hypothetical in its declaration—positions one’s life to a very radical question: what does frame and shape your life?

If this kind of freedom would exist and or would be reached by someone, then this someone would be confronted by this kind of query.

What would happen then, if work would shift to a different grade of importance in the making of one’s life?

(This already somehow contradicts the nature of democracy itself, which is participation: if everyone takes part in its processes, they would all be at work, in some form.

What makes a difference then, is)
