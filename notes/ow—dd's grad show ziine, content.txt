*Title and extended version of your caption*:
In a post-work society made possible by machinic intelligence, what is a user? And, what effects does the internet have on the concept of labor?

A Google Chrome Extension called *ow—drawing-cursor*, acts as an exercise in performing one’s own agency when in the position of internet user.

A video interview with philosopher and writer Federico Campagna expands the project’s inquiry from labour on the internet, to questions about the shift toward universal basic income-based societies, the relationship between the human and the machinic, and what work does mean nowadays.

A zine compiles some extracts from the essay *ow—Labour in a Post-work, Posthuman society*.
